As the car passes along the factory line, it gradually takes on shape until at the end, the car is complete and driven off to the carpark.\n\n","env":[]},{"id":"da7936d50a5b762c","type":"group","z":"ac7774554793f417","name":"Data flows","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["c0c373c795859694","e67429070592ba53","8d61f790f5ea511d"],"x":29,"y":94,"w":630,"h":82},{"id":"c0c373c795859694","type":"function","z":"ac7774554793f417","g":"da7936d50a5b762c","name":"function 23","func":"\nreturn msg;","outputs":1,"noerr":0,"initialize":"","finalize":"","libs":[],"x":344,"y":135,"wires":[["8d61f790f5ea511d"]]},{"id":"e67429070592ba53","type":"inject","z":"ac7774554793f417","g":"da7936d50a5b762c","name":"","props":[{"p":"payload"},{"p":"topic","vt":"str"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","x":135,"y":135,"wires":[["c0c373c795859694"]]},{"id":"8d61f790f5ea511d","type":"debug","z":"ac7774554793f417","g":"da7936d50a5b762c","name":"debug 65","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"false","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":553,"y":135,"wires":[]}]
