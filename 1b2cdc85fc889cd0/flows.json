This is trivial.<p>Let's see a couple of examples.<p>Database connection contention:\n```\nasync function() {\n  let connection = getConnection().await; // Allocate resource\n  connection.execute(\"SELECT 'Hello World!'\").await; // <- yield to the scheduler, connection is held onto until continuation is scheduled\n  connection.close().await; // Release resource\n}\n```\nThis is an extremely trivial example, and this already leaks resources. If you launch 100 of these then there is a chance that there will be 100 open connections at the same time. Had you used a simple thread pool, the size of that pool limits the number of open connections.<p>Memory leak:\n```\nasync function() {\n  let object = stream.readLargeObject().await; <- Memory allocated\n  process1(object).await; <- Memory leaked to scheduler until continuation is scheduled\n  return process2(object).await;\n}\n```\nAgain, very trivial example, already leaking. process1 and process2 are not tied together with direct control flow edges but rather the flow dispatches through the coroutine scheduler, and they are holding onto the resources while sitting in the scheduler's bookkeeping. Again, yields disrupt the allocation's scope, and if you launch a lot of these coroutines you'll run out of memory.<p>This issue is made worse if you need to use <i>combinations</i> of resource allocations. For example DB connection + memory allocation or network + disk or even network+network are common combos. Depending on the complexity of the allocation nesting you can run into very nasty contention issues or even deadlocks, where - again - a threadpool would have worked well. N threads, N number of resources. Done.<p>I want to stress that there <i>are</i> ways to mitigate the above (queues/resource pools/semaphores), however they are not nearly as intuitive as using a threadpool, and you need to be constantly aware of these leaks when you're writing async code.</p>"},{"id":"1e6c04b20a66974","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by deafpolygon in \"Tell HN: YouTube beat uBlock Origin on Firefox\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:13:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:13:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3819.84765625,"y":2256,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359456\n<hr>\n<p>Edge with UBlock Origin is still working for me.</p>"},{"id":"a4f21fc74abd5802","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by eastbound in \"Wavacity â a FOSS port of Audacity to the web\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:13:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:13:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3893.8408203125,"y":338.8185979669744,"wires":[["686b07ee92ad4f31"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359454\n<hr>\n<p>You said it: Designed for content consumption.

But the <i>social agenda</i> as spoon fed top down isnât deliberately aimed at the outcome this kid would have faced in the US.<p>That outcome would have been kafkaesque but still just a product of shitty incentives at various socio-cultural levels. That would have made him an outlier, one of a few dozens of individuals abused in this way. Horrific, yes, and to be held up against progressive values of freedom as absolute failures of our systems to function properly. Exemplars of how our ostensible values sometimesâ and maybe oftenâ fail to be realized in action and fact. And even how there are still lurking undercurrents of more systemic problems that must be uprooted and dealt with.<p>But these failures are a whisper compared to the deliberate and overt and systematic, unflinching and unabashed abuses that occur elsewhere. Uyghurs in China are an obvious but too often ignored example.<p>All too often a false equivalency is made between the two ends of the spectrum, not to mention the gradations in between. In many ways itâs a paradox of freedom that we in the west are only able to be vocal about the outlier hypocrisies of our countries <i>because</i> we have the freedom to do so with significantly less fear of life-changing consequences.<p>It isâ¦ I donât know, ironic? Tragic? Certainly inconvenientâ¦ but the exact freedoms we have in more progressive countries allow us to amplify our outlier failings on these issues to the point that more oppressive nations can use that as rhetorical ammunition and propagandistic cover for their own more deliberate and massively scaled efforts in further deliberate extremes of such efforts.</p>"},{"id":"4b3b5a952be2beec","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by mdp2021 in \"Singapore in Colour\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:16:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:16:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1706.9970703125,"y":1653.8466542119554,"wires":[["d1b379411c876f81"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359468\n<hr>\n<p>Good concept, improper expression.

But I would consider coroutines to be at the same layer of abstraction as simple procedures.<p>Now, you can build coroutine systems on top of procedural semantics (and trivially vice-versa) â indeed this is how many coroutine implementations are built under the hood â and since we're so used to procedural programming it's natural to assume that coroutines are a magical abstraction layer on top of procedures.<p>But from a strictly semantic perspective (disregarding implementation), I think coroutines are best thought of as their own distinct class of non-procedural control flow, as generalisations of procedures.<p>Being generalisations, coroutines provide fewer restrictions, but also fewer guarantees than procedures. So I don't think they're appropriate for all code. Specifically, coroutines kill temporal proximity guarantees: if everything is a coroutine, everything can suspend at any time (to be fair, any procedure can fail to return, but this is rarer). It's similar to exceptions in that respect.<p>So your point about tracking bugs is extremely relevant. With great power comes great responsibility. The current approach is to isolate coroutine functionality from the procedural core (either by very explicitly making them objects like Python generators, or by colouring them and requiring them to be executed in a context like in Kotlin). But I don't think they are quite as magical as they seem, rather just different.<p>(Tangential note: I've always thought it would be interesting to have a language that flipped this, and embedded procedural guarantees within an all-coroutine (or even all-continuations) semantic structure.)</p>"},{"id":"2bb5fce56e764407","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by RobinL in \"So You're an American?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:28:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:28:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2592.84765625,"y":3790,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359525\n<hr>\n<p>There's an important element of cultural contacts.

It was more that if you didn't know an address you could bet that the pub would help direct.  (Probably wouldn't work anymore because all the rural pubs are closing)<p>Theres a difference between a system and embodied knowledge. I did a lot of work with systems which used Irish addresses early in my career.<p>\"An Post\", pre-eircode operated off a traditional hierarchical address system. Where there were \"Counties\" a real political boundary, \"Post towns\" which were usually big market towns but the location of a major sorting office, \"Localities\" (sometimes more than one) which were geographically undefined (we tried) at worst areas and some combination of street and buildings.  The hierarchy was not strictly defined, it was a bit hungover.<p>My own address can be a combination of:\n<House number>  <Street>, <Post town>\n<House number>  <Street>, <Locality>+, <Post town><p>Most of these were optional.  The \"Pub\" thing is a testament to how awesome the staff at An Post are at just getting a letter to a door. If you needed to send a letter to \"Mary O'Shea\" who you knew lived in Kerry and near \"Paudie O'Sheas pub\" you can bet that if you put \"Mary O'Shea, Near Paudie O'Shea's Pub, Kerry\" you can bet the letter would get to Kerry, someone in Kerry would know Paudie O'Sheas is in Ventry, Send it on to Dingle and he postie doing the rounds in Ventry would be like \"Ah right, thats for Mary\" and the only catch being: about 60% of the Female population of West Kerry are probably called some combination of \"Mary\" and \"O'Shea\".<p>I'd imagine logistics companies were dancing for joy with every house having a unique post-code.</p>"},{"id":"b01d29a00cabe5ba","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by tonyg in \"Philosophy of Coroutines\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:36:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 08:36:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":205,"y":4762.857142857145,"wires":[["f8f1df5ee255c2cb"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359570\n<hr>\n<p>Yep.

Last time I added up what I actually paid in tax it was around 4%, both in Norway with similar tax levels to Sweden, and in the UK.</p>"},{"id":"9699756094241c38","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by jonatron in \"A Critical Analysis of the What3Words Geocoding Algorithm\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4585,"y":4875.788923707072,"wires":[["23b21569d4952c57"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359886\n<hr>\n<p>Your own previous comment doesn't match this take: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21218385\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21218385</a></p>"},{"id":"7de439c5b845d5e4","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by lapcat in \"Pooling and Sharing of wealth makes everyone's wealth grow faster\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":345,"y":3527.1993937942243,"wires":[["a28f2192dfcf91a6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359885\n<hr>\n<p>> Dunno why everybody is using this thread to compare the EU to the US, as if I cared about how it is in the US.<p>Because the comment that you replied to was comparing the EU to the US: \"And everyone benefits from this kind of collective solidarity - our societies are far less combative (both in the literal and the proverbial sense) than the US are.\"</p>"},{"id":"d3e6f9eb50d4bc47","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by Angostura in \"The Mystery of the Bloomfield Bridge\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4705,"y":1686.5660177760253,"wires":[["4a7c962b588c3384"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359884\n<hr>\n<p>A great find, OP thank you for posting.

Iâm sure this isnât an original idea, but Iâm not an economist.<p>The argument goes like this: the wealthy members of society have a higher quality of life when income inequality is not extreme. Not because of diminished social ostracism, but because the luxury products they want to consume would not exist without the markets and broad consumer base to fund them.<p>In other words, the average wealthy person today has access to technology, exotic food, plumbing, fast cars, etc. that even kings didnât have a few centuries ago. These things only exist because wealth was sufficiently distributed to incentivize their development. Many or most of them would not exist in a world of extreme inequality, if only from lack of interest (e.g., a wealthy 17th century aristocrat isnât going to start a plumbing business, but the son of a tradesman will.)<p>The conclusion of this is that from a purely selfish point of view, the wealthy have a vested interest in not centralizing all wealth.</p>"},{"id":"683f733651b3e3a","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by gmerc in \"Singapore in Colour\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:28:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1696.9970703125,"y":2100.773917289403,"wires":[["d1b379411c876f81"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359880\n<hr>\n<p>Having lived in a variety of placesâ¦ Iâm not sure I would phrase it that way, but I didnât find âSouthernersâ to be remarkably hospitable or Canadians overwhelmingly polite.<p>Itâs hard to piece the expat bubble in Singapore - because many people come here for a few years, live in Condos and send their kids to International school and work in MNCs, so getting to know locals can be tough and take a while.<p>And thatâs not necessarily because people donât want to mingle, it just is.<p>- You need a green card equivalent to send your kids to local school and even if you have it, the curriculum is easily a year, if not 2 ahead of other countries (because of high investment in education, different school culture and the practical need to offset 2 years of military service following school and maintain international competitiveness)<p>- You canât buy government housing that 80% of locals live in as a foreigner unless you have the equivalent of a green card and fulfill a long list of requirements (including finding a block with space for your race)<p>- Your job is gonna be in an MNC which will be a lot more mixed.<p>If you live here long enough without getting home sick and overcome these, yes you will make local friends and I would say they will more likely be well educated, well travelled and fun to hang out with, especially when it comes to anything food or travel.<p>But warm blooded?

Central planning doesnt work, farmers with intimate knowledge of their fields and crops were much more effective and motivated than then some random workers who tought mainly about themselves and stealing common property rather some common good.<p>Corruption, selfishness, laziness are things that collapse any similar pipe dream society, or make it at least very ineffective.</p>"},{"id":"3b9241a40206ffa0","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by RandomLensman in \"Pooling and Sharing of wealth makes everyone's wealth grow faster\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:42:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:42:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":375,"y":4125.989534198116,"wires":[["a28f2192dfcf91a6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359956\n<hr>\n<p>I don't think economics as such has really any trouble explaining and even seeing potential financial crises.<p>I would even go so far as to say economics also explains quite well why usually nothing substantial is done to prevent them.</p>"},{"id":"6925a8451276f6da","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by vidarh in \"Pooling and Sharing of wealth makes everyone's wealth grow faster\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:42:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:42:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":345,"y":3954.9066369398615,"wires":[["a28f2192dfcf91a6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359955\n<hr>\n<p>Check OECD Taxing Wages because you throw out unfounded accusations of lying, and you can see for yourself what average earners and people earning 167% pay in the OECD countries.

You can essentially tie your resources to your threads, and your threadpool's size becomes your resources' allocation limit. In fact one common strategy is to use thread local storage to cache certain resources like RNG or regex statemachines/parsers, and you have essentially a guarantee that you'll be fine(ofc as long as the code doesn't launch threads left and right).<p>Again, I'm not saying that you <i>can't</i> manage this with coroutines, but it <i>is</i> harder, and I've seen this problem pop up in very different contexts/languages(Kotlin/Java, Rust, Haskell) whenever coroutines are used. Large churn or an unexpected bottleneck(e.g. network saturated or disrupted) causing blowup of suspended coroutines that in turn leak resources without applying proper backpressure. When this happens coroutines <i>tend</i> to be harder to debug as well.<p>Plain threads work for disk IO, network IO, memory usage etc etc, and the resource allocations also <i>compose</i> well. E.g. classic flipped order resource alloc: coroutine 1 allocates bounded resource A, then tries to allocate B and yields. Coroutine 2 allocates B, then tries to allocate A, bam, deadlock once A's resource pool is depleted. Essentially suspended coroutines have hidden dependency edges on one another through resources. With threads, the thread pool size aligns precisely with the resource pool size, under high churn it will be the resource's actual slowness that blocks the pool temporarily, but there's no way to deadlock on resource allocations.</p>"},{"id":"afc479fd5397692d","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by exec1 in \"Doing laundry on campus without a phone\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:41:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 09:41:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1056.6664581298828,"y":234.05748980978296,"wires":[["ce116b7b3f3adb13"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37359952\n<hr>\n<p>It doesnât take much effort to remain relatively safe on the internet so you donât have to resort to dedicated hardware just for banking.

The basic claim is this:<p>\"Expected value (a mathematical object belonging to the very rigorous field of probability theory) is often used by economists in a non-rigorous way.\"<p>The covert implication is something along the lines of, economists do this deliberately to gain the benefit of rigor that the empirical performance of economic theory hasn't earned. You should definitely interpret that first as a political argument, motivated by a metaphysical argument, motivated by a mathematical argument.<p>And you're right to hear some alarm bells, because that's certainly a controversial claim.<p>But it's not an <i>outlandish</i> claim. The field of psycho-economics is basically the study of the many ways that people observably, empirically don't make economic decisions on the basis of EV maximization, so what more need be said?<p>And there are plenty of other metaphysical arguments that you probably accept in principle. Pascal's Wager, and the converse Pascal's Mugging, clearly show that EV at least has to \"break down at high energy levels\", to borrow a metaphor.<p>So, this thought experiment is one of those, but it's actually a pretty elegant one:<p>In a series of two coin flips you have four outcomes, so your expected value is a quarter of (0.6<i>0.6) + (0.6</i>1.5) + (1.5<i>0.6) + (1.5</i>1.5) = about 4.4 over four = about 110% of your stake. So this is a winning gamble, so EV maximization predicts you will take it.<p>However: more than half of that EV, (1.5<i>1.5)/4 = 56% out of that 110%, comes from the relatively rare event in which you win two coin flips in a row.<p>The other three outcomes have to share the remaining 54% EV between them. It should make sense by now that if you lose, and play again, you can expect to lose again, </i>despite* still having a positive EV on the toss.<p>So the essential question the author is asking, the thing that makes this <i>metaphysically</i> controversial but not mathematically so, is this:<p>Assuming there's no mechanism to actually <i>share</i> the EV, how much should those three out of four parallel-universe versions of you who individually <i>lose</i>, and collectively have to come up with the cash to pay out 2x winnings, care about the <i>one</i> out of four of you who's taking those 2x winnings home?<p>And the political question is: Does more than 1/4 of you still think EV is a good basis for decision making absent a mechanism to actually share the EV?</p>"},{"id":"203748be96fdc4a3","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by lifthrasiir in \"Unicode 88 (1988) [pdf]\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:09:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:09:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2202.5068172451797,"y":4043.6373154215357,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37360086\n<hr>\n<p>> The issue is doing a unified codepoint right run into problems of accepting that zh-CN/zh-HK/zh-TW and ja-JP/kr-KR each uses slightly different definitions for every letters in common use, which is not just memory inefficient but also have to do with Taiwanese identity problem.<p>I'm not sure what exactly you wanted to say, but all of six or seven variants of Han characters are substantially different from each other.

So if you're living paycheck to paycheck, it's not that hard to go bankrupt if you don't have the income to pay your mortgage, car loan, etc.</p>"},{"id":"c6a47ce1cc4d9062","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by whoopdedo in \"The Mystery of the Bloomfield Bridge\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:25:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:25:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4715,"y":1045.890380859375,"wires":[["4a7c962b588c3384"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37360173\n<hr>\n<p>> The best search terms were not road names, they were people's names.<p>Demonstrating once again that it's not what you know, it's who you know.</p>"},{"id":"8743b4ab13b7ac44","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by thiht in \"Tell HN: YouTube beat uBlock Origin on Firefox\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:25:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:25:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3250.58642578125,"y":4262.690673828125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37360172\n<hr>\n<p>Side note: the display of this thread is completely broken on mobile: <a href=\"https://ibb.co/cLJS6pX\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ibb.co/cLJS6pX</a><p>How can I notify someone to take a look at it?</p>"},{"id":"afcaae7b2f4ed13a","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by ffhhttt in \"Plan for 55,000-acre utopia dreamed by Silicon Valley elites unveiled\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:25:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 10:25:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3049.4267578125,"y":1037.9136413574213,"wires":[["b89c5a5268c2b840"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37360171\n<hr>\n<p>Paris âcityâ is just the most heavily urbanized central core of a massive metropolitan area.

NIMBYs will say they want social housing, but they won't vote in taxes to pay for it (in CA, every tax increase must pass in a ballot referendum), nor do they actually want it built anywhere, either.

The two cities arenât even remotely similar.<p>I took a look at the report you mentioned and I think the chart might be misleading you. Yes, the chart does give those rankings. But look at the prose:<p>> As with other pillars, personal security inputs and outputs have a high level of statistical correlation. Within this context, some individual cases differ markedly. On personal security outputs, Singapore scores an average of 97.3, markedly ahead of second place Copenhagen (92.7) and well over the index average (67.2). At the same time, it finishes in 40th place on inputs (51.7), falling below the average (57.3). Although the most extreme case, several other Asian cities, notably Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul and Taipei, have much lower input than output scores.<p>Whatâs all this about inputs and outputs? Well inputs are the effort a city puts into promoting personal security, and outputs are how good the personal security actually is.<p>Here are the inputs for personal security:<p><pre><code>  - Use of data-driven techniques for crime\n  - Gun regulation and enforcement\n  - a) Threat of terrorism\n  - b) Threat of military conflict\n  - c) Threat of civil unrest\n  - a) Police personnel per capita\n  - b) Prosecution personnel per capita\n  - c) Professional judges or magistrate personnel per capita\n  - Expenditure on social security\n  - a) Laws on domestic violence\n  - b) Laws on sexual harassment\n</code></pre>\nAnd here are the outputs for personal security:<p><pre><code>  - a) Prevalence of petty crime\n  - b) Prevalence of violent crime\n  - Organised crime\n  - Severity of terrorist attacks\n  - Deaths from substance use disorders\n  - Level of corruption\n  - Enforceability of contracts\n  - a) Income inequality levels\n  - b) Share of population in vulnerable employment\n  - a) Female homicide rates\n  - b) Prevalence of domestic violence\n</code></pre>\nIn short, the report you are citing is saying that not only is Singapore by far the safest city, but in fact itâs the safest despite putting comparatively little effort into it.<p>This is what other commenters here mean when they complain that a lot of the criticism of Singapore here is from afar without experiencing or understanding the place.

Indeed, I've noticed what I would consider considerable cognitive load in certain dreams.<p>Here's a great example.  I recently had a dream in which I was at a party, playing a game with some friends. We had to come up with a silly name for a person, given their profession.  I was assigned \"dentist,\" and so I thought through some possibilities: Paul A. Tooth, Paula Tooth, Paul M. Out, Paul M. Allout, etc.<p>Then another person at the party, who was assigned \"obstetrician,\" announced the silly name they had come up with, and I chuckled at it.  What's fascinating to me is that until they announced the name, I had no perception of the critical thinking necessary to construct it -- even though it was my own brain that was creating it!  Somehow, as I was perceiving myself thinking up silly dentist names, another part of my brain was simultaneously thinking up silly obstetrician names, but I could only perceive the thinking about dentists.<p>Isn't it fascinating that our brains can pull that off?</p>"},{"id":"e10fb278c6101181","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by quickthrower2 in \"What are dreams for?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 12:20:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 12:20:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2999.931587743513,"y":3991.164730836387,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37360857\n<hr>\n<p>Not everyone is paralysed in sleep of course.</p>"},{"id":"1c6c5a76664138ac","type":"subflow:4d57ed4efd49db14","z":"1b2cdc85fc889cd0","name":"New comment by rootxnet in \"Ask HN: Freelancer?
