It leaves out speculating on falling prices by short-selling.  Or speculating on (or against) volatility, instead of a specific price move.<p>Or speculating that certain correlations will stay relevant (or will cease being relevant).<p>> Bubble can be defined as when the general price level in a market is decided mainly by speculation.<p>Speculators try to guess at future conditions and benefit from anticipating them today.

Acting on the expectation tends to bring the anticipated future price into the present.<p>But there's no reason it should be particularly high or particularly low.<p>Financial markets are all about this kind of anticipation.  Eg you buy a zero coupon bond, because you expect it to be more valuable in the future than today.

Ad sellers cannot have perfect information for probably several reasons. For all the tin-foil hat discussions on privacy, the big ones are not going to treat your information as a free-for-all, especially from inside the same company for auditing, privacy, safety, and legal reasons. Evidence of this is that ads are reported as being encrypted between business units (e.g. if you work on ranking product listings, you may no idea what ad is injected at the top).<p>Obviously the result looks stupid to us as consumers which is quite memorable. I suggest it is a by-product of intentional choices.

Water usage has gone WAY down, especially for energy star washers. You may see 2.5 gallon pre-rinse/wash, 1 gallon rinse cycle usage now. Heavily soiled dishes are relying on the filtration system to remove the particles rather than spraying gunk back on the dishes.<p>2. Post-rinse drying cycles use hot water and evaporation/condensation (via stainless steel tubs) rather than hot air.

I suspect this is because the additional agents in pods have made the pre-wash cycle less effective. However, this means there may be even less time before the main wash cycle for water to heat - it is hard to tell if there is a rule whether to delay washing until it has water to temperature if the source water was cold.</p>"},{"id":"86289615765764c6","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by hnarn in \"Mystery 'golden egg' found on ocean floor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:45:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:45:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6606,"y":3000,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465334\n<hr>\n<p>> I assume biological as in ‘made by’ someone<p>When is that ever the definition of “biological”?</p>"},{"id":"36b0327262628a8a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by kown7 in \"Git Based SDLC\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:45:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:45:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8546,"y":2160,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465333\n<hr>\n<p>I haven't really considered security/rights management yet, that's a good point.</p>"},{"id":"2576d6c6fb6d0e1b","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jkaplowitz in \"GitHub education pack requesting real name on public profile\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:45:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:45:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6600,"y":2640,"wires":[["5e5672764b47c3e3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465332\n<hr>\n<p>Facebook has always officially had a real name requirement.

Take a look at the reducing functions in clojure.core - the 3-arity, innermost function returned inside all the transducers. They almost never do anything with result which would be the accumulator in a normal reduction - they just pass it on or return it. In fact, it wouldn't make much sense for transducers to do any sort of reduction because if they did, you'd no longer be doing a step-wise transform over a sequence, and you could just use normal function composition because you'd have a single value to pass forward. The reduced mechanism is only really used in transducers to short circuit, so even there the name clouds the meaning. The only time that something we'd recognise as reduction is happening is when you call transduce and specify a reducing function as its f argument. You'll have seen lots of examples with + as the reducing function because it handily returns 0 when called with no args, acts as identity with 1 arg, and reduces (actually reduces!) with two args. But instead look at sequence which can take an xform. It's implemented in Java code, but the inner reducing function it uses completely ignores the accumulator value! Everywhere you're using result inside a reducing function? It's just null and ignored. But sequence elsewhere stashes away the (transformed) output of the transducer stack and lets you have it back as a sequence. No reducing is happening, just transforming sequences. Elsewhere, into supports an xform argument - what's its reducing function? It's just conjing stuff back together! So to me, the interesting bits of transducers are that they give you an efficient and composable way of creating sequence-to-sequence transformations. Any and all mentions of reducers are necessary plumbing but slightly distracting from the core ideas.</p>"},{"id":"5ece61a195da17a8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by harry8 in \"A group of open source Android apps without ads and unnecessary permissions\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:59:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:59:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":530,"y":1640,"wires":[["171c9622faafb23"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465433\n<hr>\n<p>These are great.

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a2e4374399cd027d","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"A more dynamic software I/O TLB","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:33:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:33:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4838.53926236685,"y":4218.987422902748,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/940973/\">https://lwn.net/Articles/940973/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461489\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461489</a></p>\n<p>Points: 54</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>"},{"id":"dfa4d70c1b7ac883","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Historical Objects: The Bees of Childeric I","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:26:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:26:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4216.944143343653,"y":3391.003434877822,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://justhistoryposts.com/2023/09/05/historical-objects-the-bees-of-childeric-i/\">https://justhistoryposts.com/2023/09/05/historical-objects-the-bees-of-childeric-i/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460236\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460236</a></p>\n<p>Points: 31</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"}]
