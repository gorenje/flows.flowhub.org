every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"fe8474f94b1000ed","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Gen Z is giving up on college","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:35:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:35:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4742,"y":780,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/gen-z-is-giving-up-on-college/\">https://www.businessinsider.nl/gen-z-is-giving-up-on-college/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463676\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463676</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 45</p>"},{"id":"3f30c40143df84bc","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"HDMI ISA graphics card for vintage PCs by improving the Graphics Gremlin","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:38:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:38:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2842,"y":2832,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://yeokhengmeng.com/2023/09/hdmi-isa-graphics-card-for-vintage-pcs/\">https://yeokhengmeng.com/2023/09/hdmi-isa-graphics-card-for-vintage-pcs/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"daffe722b507cce3","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"How could the early Unix OS comprise so few lines of code?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:14:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:14:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1992,"y":2640,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/26083/how-could-early-unix-os-comprise-so-few-lines-of-code\">https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/26083/how-could-early-unix-os-comprise-so-few-lines-of-code</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5e7163dfc732abcd","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"To make dishwashers great again?

I'd guess they'll ride until they don't want to any more and not because of injury.</p>"},{"id":"a2793306eb7e8376","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by johnnyanmac in \"Gen Z is giving up on college\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:26:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:26:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4360,"y":780,"wires":[["fe8474f94b1000ed"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464768\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"9725152a9aa29d35","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by weikju in \"GitHub education pack requesting real name on public profile\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:26:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:26:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6600,"y":2260,"wires":[["5e5672764b47c3e3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464767\n<hr>\n<p>Unless you posted that sarcastically (hard to read on the internet), it's interesting you posted that under a pseudonym using what looks like an icloud \"hide my email\" address...</p>"},{"id":"d5d09f5f788be4d7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by OJFord in \"To make dishwashers great again?

This  functionality  is becoming largely replaceble by llm’s who are also competent at that level of system complexity.<p>The leading medical solution for CFS is pacing and a web link. Chatgpt could do that.<p>Once you are past a certain level of system complexity - root cause analysis becomes useless as changing one part of the system affects the other parts unpredictably.<p>I am diagnosed with CFS. Didn’t seek the diagnosis, denied it initially which is not the norm.I now pretend I don’t have it as that is the best way to cure it.<p>But beating it was hell as you literally get given an A4 sheet of paper explaining the condition when diagnosed. And your brain is exhausted after reading the sheet. But that is all you have.<p>So you are supposed to take that A4 sheet of paper and troubleshoot your way out of the condition when the instructions on the A4 sheet don’t even work.<p>The best way I can describe it is you find yourself in a shame riddled labyrinth, your brain doesn’t work, you are tired and in pain and you are told to accept your new normal.<p>There are ways out of the labyrinth. A doctor doesn’t have the map though.<p>The best way to describe chronic fatigue is extreme sensitivity to over exertion. You walk to the mailbox and 24 to 72 hours later your body reacts like you’ve run the boston marathon and the mind reacts like you’ve just pulled an all nighter to manually sort 7 tabs of 3 columns and 10,000 rows of a spreadsheet on a 17 inch monitor under time pressure while hung over,  3 days into the flu in order to resurrect hitler.<p>CFS exhaustion and brain fog can get triggered by any stress response. And it kicks in 24 to 72 hours after stress exposure.<p>The Doc says pacing and mindfullness will save you. Except it won’t.<p>The body can get stuck in unhealthy stable states. I always encourage people to look at the roche biochemistry chart (with about the same success rate as treatment plans for CFS) to understand that the body can be hypersensitive to overexertion (mental or physical) for an infinite number of combinations.<p>Fortunately there are a quite a number of things that you can do to escape the labyrinth.<p>- Explain to anyone that cares that there is a medical field dedicated to assessing levels of debilitation and that cfs is as debilitating as cancer. (Very few people care)<p>- get stable accommodation.<p>- Get a comfortable supportive bed to convalesce in.<p>- Eat a diet that minimises inflammation - deeply boiled veges, rice, potatoe or sweet potatoe, grass/algal fed free range protein, olive oil. Maintain steady blood sugar.<p>- Body strength train.<p>- Sort out a vitamin and supplement regime with a genetic analysis.<p>- Take an anger management course to understand the anger of others.<p>-Understand pain - the curable app on chronic pain management is highly beneficial.<p>- Learn to forgive. Resentment ruins health.<p>- Get a career you are capable of. Aim low.<p>- Get regular physical activity.<p>- Perform improvisational comedy to condition the mind to cope with an onslaught of public social pressure.<p>- Pretend you don’t have chronic fatigue syndrome.<p>What doctors get wrong ( it is hard for them to comprehend the condition as most aren’t susceptible as they were tough enough to get through medical school)  is that chronic avoidance is the right strategy until your body can cope with stress without fatiguing.<p>It isn’t all in your head. I’d say ability to sideplank and neck strength are probably two of the most important recovery metrics. Drs don’t understand the psycho-somatic balance of the illness. There is a psychological component but it is a minor component and is driven by physical constraints.<p>The sad thing is that cfs is quite treatable but the medical profession says pacing and mindfulness is all one needs to cure something that  is as debilitating as cancer.<p>You don’t need to be  mindful to beat chronic fatigue syndrome. I think sarcasm is more beneficial when coping with a bleak future.<p>And I really like and admire Doctors - it’s not their fault that their system is terrible at creating healing treatment plans for complex chronic health conditions.</p>"},{"id":"acae00fd75ed9f70","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by belter in \"Meta deletes Al Jazeera presenter’s profile after show criticising Israel\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:24:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:24:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5464,"y":1640,"wires":[["b898b0c5cfdcaf24"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464760\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/cnj0rmnsAdI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/cnj0rmnsAdI</a></p>"},{"id":"c16a46514d9e7398","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Theodores in \"I wired up my bike's GPS to order me pizza during a gravel race\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:24:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:24:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7810,"y":3392,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464759\n<hr>\n<p>Exactly.

Vivaldi indeed allows much more customization, but for my tab-heavy browsing pattern Edge's (and now Brave's) way suits much more. For example some things I don't like in Vivaldi:<p>- No colors. In Edge/Brave new color is auto-assigned when creating new tab group and can be overridden at any time.\n- When tab group is expanded, the group name/header is not shown. When you have many groups with similar tabs they are much less visually distinct from each other.\n- Moving new tab to one of previous collapsed groups can be easily done via context menu in Edge.

It leaves out speculating on falling prices by short-selling.  Or speculating on (or against) volatility, instead of a specific price move.<p>Or speculating that certain correlations will stay relevant (or will cease being relevant).<p>> Bubble can be defined as when the general price level in a market is decided mainly by speculation.<p>Speculators try to guess at future conditions and benefit from anticipating them today.

Acting on the expectation tends to bring the anticipated future price into the present.<p>But there's no reason it should be particularly high or particularly low.<p>Financial markets are all about this kind of anticipation.  Eg you buy a zero coupon bond, because you expect it to be more valuable in the future than today.

Ad sellers cannot have perfect information for probably several reasons. For all the tin-foil hat discussions on privacy, the big ones are not going to treat your information as a free-for-all, especially from inside the same company for auditing, privacy, safety, and legal reasons. Evidence of this is that ads are reported as being encrypted between business units (e.g. if you work on ranking product listings, you may no idea what ad is injected at the top).<p>Obviously the result looks stupid to us as consumers which is quite memorable. I suggest it is a by-product of intentional choices.
