The solution should thus be state-funded competition for apartments, driving institutionals out of the low/mid end of the market. This doesn't necessarily mean the state needs to build themselves.

The underlying physics is that the length of the waterline influences the wake system that a boat creates between its bow and tail wave. Those waves interfere constructively and at a certain speed, they start adding up to significant waves - the bow wave starts to pile up more and more. The boat needs to ride up the wave. Drag rises sharply at that point - so a stronger engine helps little at this point.<p>This used to be called the “hull speed”, the maximum speed that a hull can achieve. (It’s grossly simplistic and outdated concept, but a workable estimate).<p>Going beyond requires either a longer waterline or switching from displacement to planing. Some hull shapes can exceed their nominal hull speeds somewhat, but not indefinitely. This is a concern if you tow a small vessel with a larger vessel that can run faster than the small vessels hull speed. You can sink a boat by creating a large enough bow wave.<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_speed\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_speed</a></p>"},{"id":"bb06326a1cb6d83f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by qobbysam in \"Ask HN: Freelancer?

When I was 17, I developed acute neuropathy after covid which was diagnosed via a biopsy. It manifested as orthostatic intolerance caused by insufficient blood flow to my brain. I have been bedridden for around two years now. I was certainly distressed when I got COVID, largely because of a burning pain emanating from my extremities. My uncle died from autoimmune scleroderma. He also developed Lymphoma, whose pathology we believe began with Epstein-Barr.<p>The prevailing hypothesis is a cross reactive species of auto antibodies to the Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor. I unfortunately have not been able to receive a test for this antibody; however, I did test positive for Alpha and Beta adrenergic autoantibodies along with Muscarinic M2 and M4 autoantibodies targeting the hippocampus of my brain. I managed a borderline positive titer for anti TSHDS antibodies, which are correlated with small fiber neuropathy.<p>Normally, I do not comment, and I specifically made an account to type this message while holding a laptop over my head, a difficult task as you can imagine. The medical community is moving too slow in response to post Covid syndromes. I and all the other people affected with neurologic complications would be most appreciative if you all helped review literature on the immune system. It is an awful lot like debugging code! Right now, I read a section about Janus Kinase and TNF alpha. I believe a medication like baracitinib would do a wonderful job mediating mthe inflammatory response. ICU covid patients typically died from TNF alpha, Interleukin 6, and Cysteinyl Leukotriene 1 mediated by 5 lipoxygenase synthesis from arachidonic acid. All of these biomarkers are elevated  in long covid patients. Lastly, covid can actually cause a reactivation of Epstein-Barr and HSV1. Telemisartan is an Angiotensin receptor blocker that can downregulate ACE2 levels in the body and demonstrates a prophylactic effect against covid.<p>If you read this far, I am deeply appreciative. More so than monetary donations, I would be grateful if could spread the message about this disorder.</p>"},{"id":"11f6f60a5a812086","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by OscarTheGrinch in \"A Student-Debt Bubble Fueled a Housing Bubble\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":520,"y":3068,"wires":[["6f8f02774f90d824"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463735\n<hr>\n<p>\"Oh why won't someone think of the poor house prices!\" - wsj<p>As a homeowner I don't mind if house prices fall, that means more people will be able to afford to live in their own house.

I consider myself average looking, and I have a tendency to get fat very easily.<p>Bro. When did I say looks is the only factor of attraction for women? Your imagination is running wild and cooking up things I didn't say. LOOKS matter for men, For women they're judgement on attraction is MUCH more multi-faceted. They judge, status, they judge personality, they judge wealth, they judge career, they judge race, they judge humor, and they judge Looks. Looks is one dimension of multiple variables.<p>BUT here's the thing, looks HELP. It's a factor but men can get around that factor. If you have looks, you can do a lot worse in other categories. This isn't the point. The point is that women are HIGHLY selective. Even though women are multifaceted in their approach their bar is extremely high. Men are one dimensional in attraction but they have a lot of leeway and make a lot of exceptions.<p>That's why you see the data in dating apps. 80% of Women are pining for the top 20% of men and men are only matching with the bottom 80% of men. That's it, facts.<p>>I dated, literally, dozens of women during my years of dating app cruising, and ALL of them would emphatically explain that the main reason that they accepted to go out with me, was that I NEVER ASKED for, nor sent/asked permission for sending nude pics to them. IT REALLY is a deal breaker and a huge advantage on this market, to know these simple rules.<p>You're blind. You know when you ask a woman if looks matter they always tell you it doesn't right? They're outright blind themselves. Never ask a woman for dating advice they tell you they want a sensitive man, they want someone who cares for them, they never tell you what they really want which is a 6 foot white chad extremely rich man who will dominate them and make them feel small and feminine. You let women tell you their delusions and you eat it up and become delusional yourself. This is what you are: Living in the clouds.<p>The data shows the average man only matches 2 out 8 swipes while the average woman matches 8/10. That means women aren't even matching with most men. MOST men don't have the OPPORTUNITY to launch out a dick pic. What that means is those two men getting matched are getting hundreds of matches. Basically they can do whatever the hell they want because they have what you termed indefinite supply.  Think about it. If dick pics don't work why are certain men sending it?<p>I hate to break it to you, but any person of average intelligence can figure out dick pics don't work. If you're below average intelligence experience will eventually teach you dick pics don't work. Your advice is telling men to stop driving a car into a wall and then you walk away like your some kind of genius for that discovery. Let's just say you're not the brightest tool in the toolbox but that's besides the point. The point is that if there are still men sending dick pics it means for a certain segment of men it works. Like I said Chris hemsworth can send a dick pic to any woman and she will send him her current location and phone number and tell her to come pick her up in the middle of the night no creeper shit intended.<p>>Don't be fat. Don't be unemployed. Pay for the dinner. Do not put sex in the conversation.<p><i>rolls eyes</i> the irony here is that fat is actually more acceptable for women. In terms of physicality women place the most desirability on height. \"Don't be short\" would be the perfect addition to your little list of useless tips. EVERYBODY knows about what you just said. Garbage.<p>The other thing, \"Do not put sex in the conversation\" just shows you have no game. The art is to pick the time, pick that right place and work it into the conversation and get her horny. I'm guessing you play lame nice guy routines and get by purely off your looks. Lucky you, but you didn't earn shit and you certainly shouldn't be giving out advice given how little you know. The true players know the art of conversation and I've seen fat short guys get girls to break their rules and bed them on the first date. You aren't even close.<p>>I can't stand men that make excuses in the style of yours<p>Bro, when the fuck did I make an excuse? I am simply spitting facts. I'm saying this is the current state of the world. I'm pointing out where your wrong and when things you say are patently false because you lack knowledge. The game is harder for men that's just reality in the same way the game is just harder for overweight women. It's reality. Stating facts is NOT an excuse. It's a statement about reality. Nowhere did I tell other men to give up, nor did I say I'm giving up, I'm just laying out the conditions of the field. Jesus. Now you're acting like your some expert guru.<p>>. If a woman is born \"ugly\", it's game over. She's probably going to be a bottom feeder on the dating market. I feel REALLY sorry for ugly women when I meet one, I have a sister that is in this situation and it is not a good life.<p>This is true. The game is unfortunately even harder for your sister depending on how ugly she is. If can very much be game over her if she's disfigured. Depending on how bad her situation is her only strategy is to lower her standards by a lot. Either way, this has NOTHING to do with what I'm saying.<p>You're acting like a dating coach, and I'm telling you, you don't know shit. You have no clue about what's going on with modern dating.<p>>Choose your destiny dude.<p>I'm in a fucking relationship. God. Wake up.</p>"},{"id":"16f50482937de4e9","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by waste_monk in \"Coffee in a Can\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2268.440716826136,"y":284.36159776279374,"wires":[["598766f9a9cf94ab"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463731\n<hr>\n<p>Apparently the self-heating is chemical, triggering whatever mechanism mixes a quantity of quicklime with water, and the result is exothermic.<p>I tried a self-heating coffee once and to be fair it did heat up pretty well, but the coffee was overly bitter and kind of gross.

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"fe8474f94b1000ed","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Gen Z is giving up on college","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:35:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:35:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":992,"y":1180,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/gen-z-is-giving-up-on-college/\">https://www.businessinsider.nl/gen-z-is-giving-up-on-college/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463676\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463676</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 45</p>"},{"id":"3f30c40143df84bc","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"HDMI ISA graphics card for vintage PCs by improving the Graphics Gremlin","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:38:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:38:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7026.440716826136,"y":1820.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://yeokhengmeng.com/2023/09/hdmi-isa-graphics-card-for-vintage-pcs/\">https://yeokhengmeng.com/2023/09/hdmi-isa-graphics-card-for-vintage-pcs/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"daffe722b507cce3","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"How could the early Unix OS comprise so few lines of code?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:14:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:14:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6806.440716826136,"y":1436.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/26083/how-could-early-unix-os-comprise-so-few-lines-of-code\">https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/26083/how-could-early-unix-os-comprise-so-few-lines-of-code</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5e7163dfc732abcd","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"To make dishwashers great again?
