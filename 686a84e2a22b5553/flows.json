the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7522.440716826136,"y":348.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4998.440716826136,"y":2380.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7030.440716826136,"y":3092.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

stalls out, I have to play hot potato over their incredibly long list of available exit nodes just to try and find one that will work for another 5-10 minutes before I lose connection again.<p>Maybe

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

table.<p>Stateless NAT is also possible, but then it has to be 1:1. Which has it's purpose, but is rarely used.<p>A practical example would be with IPv6 if your ISP doesn't allocate you a static prefix. Stateless NAT would allow you to use a /64 from the private range of fd00::/8 in your local network which the router would translate to your globally unique /64. No state needed, because there would be as many IPs available in your LAN prefix as in your GUA prefix. All it would do would be translating fdxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:1234:1234:1234:1234 to 2yyy:yyyy:yyyy:yyyy:1234:1234:1234:1234 and vice versa.<p>I've also done stateless NAT on IPv4. When you request more IPs from some cloud providers, they assign you a bunch of /32s, not a proper subnet, virtually requiring you to run a cloud router.</p>"},{"id":"110eea81184ce324","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by naveen99 in \"What happened with HMOs?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:56:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:56:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5814.440716826136,"y":2836.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461967\n<hr>\n<p>For Medicare patients, cms is pushing aco’s <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/ACO\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/...</a></p>"},{"id":"ca2059b41e021176","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by AYBABTME in \"Battery-electric fishing vessel marks a sea change for small commercial fishers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:56:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:56:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7014.440716826136,"y":4540.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461966\n<hr>\n<p>You overestimate the danger of batteries on boats.

Because out-of-network providers are by definition not contracted with the insurance carrier, they can (and do!) charge <i>you</i> whatever they want.

They’d bail for whatever insurer covered every damn thing. So insurers realized better to just jack prices rather than control costs.<p>I don't know how true this is for the HMO story, but I do know that many patients absolutely hate being told \"no\" after they've convinced themselves that they <i>need</i> a certain treatment.<p>We've all heard the stories about the patient who was right about their own diagnosis but was denied care by their doctor, but these are the rare stories. Providers get bombarded daily by demands for antibiotics for colds, for example. If you're well educated about antibiotics you probably wouldn't believe the number of people who think antibiotics treat every infection and doctors are just meanies for refusing to hand them out. Many doctors get tired of fighting these battles and just write prescription after prescription for antibiotics on demand, which creates a loyal customer base of patients who are happy because they get whatever they ask for.<p>The situation is even scarier for controlled substances. The internet and sites like Reddit have a weird way of convincing people that they <i>need</i> Adderall and/or Xanax, and that doctors are evil if they won't prescribe them no questions asked. I've heard too many horror stories from my psychiatrist friends who get patients showing up demanding Adderall, but on closer examination will describe classic depression symptoms (e.g. having trouble focusing after a recent breakup, but no problems for the first 2-3 decades of life). Some of them have been convinced by Reddit (it's always Reddit) that ADHD is the explanation to their mental health problems and a high dose of Adderall will solve all of their problems.<p>Then when they say \"no\", they get pinged a few weeks later by the psychiatrist down the hall because the patient is back with a different doctor trying the same story. The sad part is that they often continue this rotation until someone shrugs and writes the prescription. A disappointing number of providers don't mind having a lot of controlled substance patients because it's a steady stream of easy appointments to write new prescriptions every few months.</p>"},{"id":"9db1b3874ddf68e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by acheong08 in \"FYI: Google Workspaces's High-Priority Security Events Take 4 Hours to Trigger\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:11:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:11:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4588.440716826136,"y":3820.3615977627937,"wires":[["ce654303f387f42a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462065\n<hr>\n<p>What are the alternatives with similar coverage & faster response times?</p>"},{"id":"323d141a2fe02dcf","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by kyawzazaw in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

I consider myself average looking, and I have a tendency to get fat very easily. Because of that I've been training martial arts for oretty much all my life since puberty. I realize very early that just by virtue of keeping myself in shape, I started from zero instead of from a negative point. We,as men, have the luxury of not depend (almost) exclusively on our looks to attract women. It helps but is easily forgivable, way easier than for us men to accept a fat woman for instance. I dated, literally, dozens of women during my years of dating app cruising, and ALL of them would enfatically explain that the main reason that they accepted to go out with me, was that I NEVER ASKED for, nor sent/asked permission for sending nude pics to them. IT REALLY is a deal breaker and a huge advantage on this market, to know these simple rules.<p>Don't be fat. Don't be unemployed. Pay for the dinner. Do not put sex in the conversation. It's so easy to no creep off women, there's really no secret to it. If you're fat, it's your prerrogative to close your mouth. If you're (too) poor, work hard, learn how to save money and it's easy to get to your 30s on a decent enough life situation. I live in a freaking 3rd country and was able to do it, on a country where a current year iPhone costs the same as 2 years minimum wage salary.<p>I can't stand men that make excuses in the style of yours, sorry dude. Evolutionary psychology is true, I saw your otger comments. And exactly because of that, you should know that it's way easier for a man that started on the bottom tier of the dating rankings to pull himself up by his own decisions, than to a woman. If a woman is born \"ugly\", it's game over. She's probably going to be a bottom feeder on the dating market. I feel REALLY sorry for ugly women when I meet one, I have a sister that is in this situation and it is not a good life.<p>Choose your destiny dude.</p>"},{"id":"891cd39d1b0cec9d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sneak in \"Appeals court rules White House likely overstepped 1st Amendment on social media\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:17:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:17:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3862.440716826136,"y":4596.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462099\n<hr>\n<p>> <i>How do you keep a bunch of pretty hard-core fascist propagandists from stirring up the people without any repercussion?</i><p>A million Iraqis probably have the same question.<p>Preserving the ability of the public to organize and publish freely is probably one of the foundational elements of the solution to keeping a populace from getting so hijacked.

Some countries have greater power than ‘the market’ due to their military reach or trade. The US is an extreme example — international trade is largely conducted in their currency and they will and have used their hegemonic military power to maintain that. The USD interest rate is set fundamentally by the Fed. Even other sovereign states with less geopolitical power can also maintain their interest rates by their central banks voting what rate to set them at. The market effect, for them, tends to be the foreign exchange rate of their currency will vary to offset the change in interest rate. That will have some market related limits and is why many countries tend to follow the US Fed’s interest rate decisions.

An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan.</i><p>If I search \"why do people go vegan,\" on Google, as you apparently have, I get the following as the topline item: <i>Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for becoming vegan, but for many it remains the key factor in their decision to go vegan and stay vegan. Having emotional attachments with animals may form part of that reason, while many believe that all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom.</i><p>If I search \"why be vegan\" verbatim as you have, the top hit is again from the Vegan Society post and their top reason again is \"for the animals.\" So, like I said, while health is a reason, it is not the top reason. Therefore I am not \"objectively wrong.\" I am not sure why you are still stressing the point, as if most people follow the ethical philosophy of veganism for health as the #1 reason.<p>In other words, you're arguing a strawman, because, again, I never said health wasn't a reason.

And of course Brahma the creator god lives for a longer time than that - three hundred trillion years - and we're halfway through that period as well.<p>Of course all these numbers are entirely beautiful mathematical constructions and don't have any actual basis in observations or reality.</p>"},{"id":"a09c5b38888ffd6e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by zharknado in \"Mystery 'golden egg' found on ocean floor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 03:24:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 03:24:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4940.45110001999,"y":2153.742391165895,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462509\n<hr>\n<p>Schrödinger’s clam.</p>"},{"id":"ba8125f5775e0234","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by exmadscientist in \"To make dishwashers great again?
