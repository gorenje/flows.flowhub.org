Now, I’m not arguing against the article, having high student debt is certainly going to impact your ability to own a home, but it’s certainly not the only factor which is at play.<p>Our sister company develops housing for renting. Which was a very lucrative business back when interest rates weren’t evil. What they really do, however, isn’t to rent out homes, it’s making investors money. Keeping rent high is a bigger part of that journey than actually renting out homes, because ultimately the end goal isn’t to own the building, it’s to either sell it or use it as leverage in other projects that makes our investors money. In the city I live in, we have 10.000 empty dental right now, which is quite a high number in a city of a quarter of a million people, but the rent isn’t going down. It’s not going down, because it’s hard to increase if once you lower it, and since the goal isn’t really to rent out these homes but rather to make investors returns, it’s better to ride a decade of empty rentals than to lower the rent. It’s better because the finance data looks better when the potential profits are higher, and as long as that is more important than actually realising that profit then rent isn’t going to come down. Now, obviously there is some competition in the rental market, but every investment bank developer is sort of in our shoes and while it’s obviously a little bit of a game of chicken, it’s not really, because there is still a housing shortage in popular towns. But because we’re playing chicken, the smaller sized rental companies don’t actually need to compete that hard on pricing because we won’t lower ours, and there is enough of a demand that they can get a way with just being in our slipstream.<p>I’m not sure if that’s a thing in America, and there is a lot more to it than this. Here in Denmark we have the same urbanisation and population decline as many other places, so housing is very uneven with urban areas increasing prices while rural areas see theirs plummeting to the point that some homes are frankly unsellable. But it’s mainly due to general debt, and how we let people borrow too much money, which student debt is part of, but not the single contributor to.</p>"},{"id":"50770c457e8e1e82","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by m463 in \"To make dishwashers great again?

Unfortunately the engine requires linux and more importantly x86 (due to asm intructions) so I wasn't able to replicate them yet, but I would expect at least ~1 million requests/s per a pair of actors (e.g. with Erlang), otherwise the overhead is prohibilitely low.<p>The engine also focuses on message passing, but from experience it's very difficult to work with (state machines are hard, especially when working with multiple downstream actors), and at the core actors are more about isolating state without locks than message passing. Swift actors did it right in my opinion, method calls instead of messages are not only easier to reason about, they give additional hints to the runtime when context may switch without involving a scheduler at all (any shared state is slow and inhibits scalability).<p>I actually wrote a header-only library recently (search for \"coroactors\" if you're interested) that implements something similar to Swift actors with C++20 coroutines, and I thought ~10 million requests/s (when uncontended) or ~1-3 million/s (when contended and depending on a scheduler) was a way too high of an overhead, especially when compared to normal method calls with shared state protected with mutexes. Coroutines tend to go viral (with more and more functions becoming \"async\" coroutines), and any non-trivial code base would have a lot of coroutine calls (or messages passed), and that overhead needs to be as low as possible, otherwise you'd spend more time task switching than doing useful work.</p>"},{"id":"20a6cf6c75404a2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by meroes in \"Effectiveness of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:07:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:07:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5026.440716826136,"y":2260.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463477\n<hr>\n<p>Give me Google Glass so I can do both!

The underlying physics is that the length of the waterline influences the wake system that a boat creates between its bow and tail wave. Those waves interfere constructively and at a certain speed, they start adding up to significant waves - the bow wave starts to pile up more and more. The boat needs to ride up the wave. Drag rises sharply at that point - so a stronger engine helps little at this point.<p>This used to be called the “hull speed”, the maximum speed that a hull can achieve. (It’s grossly simplistic and outdated concept, but a workable estimate).<p>Going beyond requires either a longer waterline or switching from displacement to planing. Some hull shapes can exceed their nominal hull speeds somewhat, but not indefinitely. This is a concern if you tow a small vessel with a larger vessel that can run faster than the small vessels hull speed. You can sink a boat by creating a large enough bow wave.<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_speed\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_speed</a></p>"},{"id":"bb06326a1cb6d83f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by qobbysam in \"Ask HN: Freelancer?

When I was 17, I developed acute neuropathy after covid which was diagnosed via a biopsy. It manifested as orthostatic intolerance caused by insufficient blood flow to my brain. I have been bedridden for around two years now. I was certainly distressed when I got COVID, largely because of a burning pain emanating from my extremities. My uncle died from autoimmune scleroderma. He also developed Lymphoma, whose pathology we believe began with Epstein-Barr.<p>The prevailing hypothesis is a cross reactive species of auto antibodies to the Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor. I unfortunately have not been able to receive a test for this antibody; however, I did test positive for Alpha and Beta adrenergic autoantibodies along with Muscarinic M2 and M4 autoantibodies targeting the hippocampus of my brain. I managed a borderline positive titer for anti TSHDS antibodies, which are correlated with small fiber neuropathy.<p>Normally, I do not comment, and I specifically made an account to type this message while holding a laptop over my head, a difficult task as you can imagine. The medical community is moving too slow in response to post Covid syndromes. I and all the other people affected with neurologic complications would be most appreciative if you all helped review literature on the immune system. It is an awful lot like debugging code! Right now, I read a section about Janus Kinase and TNF alpha. I believe a medication like baracitinib would do a wonderful job mediating mthe inflammatory response. ICU covid patients typically died from TNF alpha, Interleukin 6, and Cysteinyl Leukotriene 1 mediated by 5 lipoxygenase synthesis from arachidonic acid. All of these biomarkers are elevated  in long covid patients. Lastly, covid can actually cause a reactivation of Epstein-Barr and HSV1. Telemisartan is an Angiotensin receptor blocker that can downregulate ACE2 levels in the body and demonstrates a prophylactic effect against covid.<p>If you read this far, I am deeply appreciative. More so than monetary donations, I would be grateful if could spread the message about this disorder.</p>"},{"id":"11f6f60a5a812086","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by OscarTheGrinch in \"A Student-Debt Bubble Fueled a Housing Bubble\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3212.440716826136,"y":2324.3615977627937,"wires":[["6f8f02774f90d824"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463735\n<hr>\n<p>\"Oh why won't someone think of the poor house prices!\" - wsj<p>As a homeowner I don't mind if house prices fall, that means more people will be able to afford to live in their own house.

I consider myself average looking, and I have a tendency to get fat very easily.<p>Bro. When did I say looks is the only factor of attraction for women? Your imagination is running wild and cooking up things I didn't say. LOOKS matter for men, For women they're judgement on attraction is MUCH more multi-faceted. They judge, status, they judge personality, they judge wealth, they judge career, they judge race, they judge humor, and they judge Looks. Looks is one dimension of multiple variables.<p>BUT here's the thing, looks HELP. It's a factor but men can get around that factor. If you have looks, you can do a lot worse in other categories. This isn't the point. The point is that women are HIGHLY selective. Even though women are multifaceted in their approach their bar is extremely high. Men are one dimensional in attraction but they have a lot of leeway and make a lot of exceptions.<p>That's why you see the data in dating apps. 80% of Women are pining for the top 20% of men and men are only matching with the bottom 80% of men. That's it, facts.<p>>I dated, literally, dozens of women during my years of dating app cruising, and ALL of them would emphatically explain that the main reason that they accepted to go out with me, was that I NEVER ASKED for, nor sent/asked permission for sending nude pics to them. IT REALLY is a deal breaker and a huge advantage on this market, to know these simple rules.<p>You're blind. You know when you ask a woman if looks matter they always tell you it doesn't right? They're outright blind themselves. Never ask a woman for dating advice they tell you they want a sensitive man, they want someone who cares for them, they never tell you what they really want which is a 6 foot white chad extremely rich man who will dominate them and make them feel small and feminine. You let women tell you their delusions and you eat it up and become delusional yourself. This is what you are: Living in the clouds.<p>The data shows the average man only matches 2 out 8 swipes while the average woman matches 8/10. That means women aren't even matching with most men. MOST men don't have the OPPORTUNITY to launch out a dick pic. What that means is those two men getting matched are getting hundreds of matches. Basically they can do whatever the hell they want because they have what you termed indefinite supply.  Think about it. If dick pics don't work why are certain men sending it?<p>I hate to break it to you, but any person of average intelligence can figure out dick pics don't work. If you're below average intelligence experience will eventually teach you dick pics don't work. Your advice is telling men to stop driving a car into a wall and then you walk away like your some kind of genius for that discovery. Let's just say you're not the brightest tool in the toolbox but that's besides the point. The point is that if there are still men sending dick pics it means for a certain segment of men it works. Like I said Chris hemsworth can send a dick pic to any woman and she will send him her current location and phone number and tell her to come pick her up in the middle of the night no creeper shit intended.<p>>Don't be fat. Don't be unemployed. Pay for the dinner. Do not put sex in the conversation.<p><i>rolls eyes</i> the irony here is that fat is actually more acceptable for women. In terms of physicality women place the most desirability on height. \"Don't be short\" would be the perfect addition to your little list of useless tips. EVERYBODY knows about what you just said. Garbage.<p>The other thing, \"Do not put sex in the conversation\" just shows you have no game. The art is to pick the time, pick that right place and work it into the conversation and get her horny. I'm guessing you play lame nice guy routines and get by purely off your looks. Lucky you, but you didn't earn shit and you certainly shouldn't be giving out advice given how little you know. The true players know the art of conversation and I've seen fat short guys get girls to break their rules and bed them on the first date. You aren't even close.<p>>I can't stand men that make excuses in the style of yours<p>Bro, when the fuck did I make an excuse? I am simply spitting facts. I'm saying this is the current state of the world. I'm pointing out where your wrong and when things you say are patently false because you lack knowledge. The game is harder for men that's just reality in the same way the game is just harder for overweight women. It's reality. Stating facts is NOT an excuse. It's a statement about reality. Nowhere did I tell other men to give up, nor did I say I'm giving up, I'm just laying out the conditions of the field. Jesus. Now you're acting like your some expert guru.<p>>. If a woman is born \"ugly\", it's game over. She's probably going to be a bottom feeder on the dating market. I feel REALLY sorry for ugly women when I meet one, I have a sister that is in this situation and it is not a good life.<p>This is true. The game is unfortunately even harder for your sister depending on how ugly she is. If can very much be game over her if she's disfigured. Depending on how bad her situation is her only strategy is to lower her standards by a lot. Either way, this has NOTHING to do with what I'm saying.<p>You're acting like a dating coach, and I'm telling you, you don't know shit. You have no clue about what's going on with modern dating.<p>>Choose your destiny dude.<p>I'm in a fucking relationship. God. Wake up.</p>"},{"id":"16f50482937de4e9","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by waste_monk in \"Coffee in a Can\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2268.440716826136,"y":300.36159776279374,"wires":[["598766f9a9cf94ab"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463731\n<hr>\n<p>Apparently the self-heating is chemical, triggering whatever mechanism mixes a quantity of quicklime with water, and the result is exothermic.<p>I tried a self-heating coffee once and to be fair it did heat up pretty well, but the coffee was overly bitter and kind of gross.

Would love to try a cocktail of things — almost anything really — to feel more alive, but I don’t want to do antidepressants, and I don’t want to be branded “drug seeking”, so I just try to get by for now.</p>"},{"id":"d193050ff36161f2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by lindsaywaterman in \"Chronic fatigue syndrome may have a post-viral infection origin\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:50:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:50:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1252.8464057414142,"y":4307.377659166952,"wires":[["e19e331df3204ab3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463784\n<hr>\n<p>Yes Temporomandibular disorders are included in the group of Central Sensitivity disorders.</p>"},{"id":"d40c35b9ebe122f0","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sanderjd in \"What I have changed my mind about in software development\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:49:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:49:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2663,"y":4030,"wires":[["69427af00552ff9d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463781\n<hr>\n<p>@VisibleForTesting is mostly documentation; you can just as easily use package private without an annotation.
