Water usage has gone WAY down, especially for energy star washers. You may see 2.5 gallon pre-rinse/wash, 1 gallon rinse cycle usage now. Heavily soiled dishes are relying on the filtration system to remove the particles rather than spraying gunk back on the dishes.<p>2. Post-rinse drying cycles use hot water and evaporation/condensation (via stainless steel tubs) rather than hot air. For ceramic/glass this is perfect, but plasticware will not get properly dried.<p>3. Pre-wash detergent cycles have started to go away. I suspect this is because the additional agents in pods have made the pre-wash cycle less effective.

Take a look at the reducing functions in clojure.core - the 3-arity, innermost function returned inside all the transducers. They almost never do anything with result which would be the accumulator in a normal reduction - they just pass it on or return it. In fact, it wouldn't make much sense for transducers to do any sort of reduction because if they did, you'd no longer be doing a step-wise transform over a sequence, and you could just use normal function composition because you'd have a single value to pass forward. The reduced mechanism is only really used in transducers to short circuit, so even there the name clouds the meaning. The only time that something we'd recognise as reduction is happening is when you call transduce and specify a reducing function as its f argument. You'll have seen lots of examples with + as the reducing function because it handily returns 0 when called with no args, acts as identity with 1 arg, and reduces (actually reduces!) with two args. But instead look at sequence which can take an xform. It's implemented in Java code, but the inner reducing function it uses completely ignores the accumulator value! Everywhere you're using result inside a reducing function? It's just null and ignored. But sequence elsewhere stashes away the (transformed) output of the transducer stack and lets you have it back as a sequence. No reducing is happening, just transforming sequences. Elsewhere, into supports an xform argument - what's its reducing function? It's just conjing stuff back together! So to me, the interesting bits of transducers are that they give you an efficient and composable way of creating sequence-to-sequence transformations. Any and all mentions of reducers are necessary plumbing but slightly distracting from the core ideas.</p>"},{"id":"5ece61a195da17a8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by harry8 in \"A group of open source Android apps without ads and unnecessary permissions\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:59:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:59:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":530,"y":1400,"wires":[["171c9622faafb23"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465433\n<hr>\n<p>These are great.

Often these are too small (code-wise) to even have private APIs, the internal behavior of the function is simply and necessarily too complex to unit test in the traditional way.<p>Some function behavior is intentionally and intrinsically tied to <i>temporal access patterns</i> in the API usage. Unless you can simulate a broad cross-section of real-world runtime API access timing patterns with your testing framework, you won't test all of the code paths. You often see this test problem with scheduler-like functions, where the correct function behavior varies based on internal resource pressures that are an interaction between temporal access patterns of the API and the runtime environment. It is a single function, self-contained, and quite simple, maybe not more than 100 LoC, but test environments are so sterile that usually only a single code path is actually used no matter what you throw at the API.<p>Some functions have critical code paths that dynamically switch strategies to mitigate when certain types of contention or resource starvation conditions are detected internally. These can be extremely rare cases across the set of possible inputs, such that fuzzing is unlikely to trigger them, or the set of inputs that can trigger them is dependent on exogenous environmental details e.g. the machine where the test is run.<p>As a fun side-effect, sometimes these functions do not have deterministic result. Getting the same result out of the function all the time does not imply correctness, you also have to know <i>why</i> you got the result you did.<p>All of the above does not apply to writing business logic in Java or similar. But for high-performance and/or high-reliability systems software, these cases come up often enough that it is a well-understood testing problem. Even if you expose all of the internal implementation detail to the unit tests it is not always possible to reliably trigger all the code paths from an arbitrary test absent purpose-built test tooling.</p>"},{"id":"eeb2d49071b38905","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by borbulon in \"Google Chrome just rolled out a new way to track you and serve ads\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:20:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:20:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6250,"y":2864,"wires":[["ce6e6eaa723b56e8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465598\n<hr>\n<p>I am against this and think it's pretty unconscionable, but I will say this in defense of Google collecting my data:<p>Google's entire business model is predicated on the fact that they and only they know who I am.

The price of water, vs the price of electricity are not what block desalination. It is the cost (and maintenance) of the machines that you need to earn back. That cost is what tends to make desalination un-economical. And that is an area where engineering has a lot of space to improve.</p>"},{"id":"339d3520fec4f2c3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by medler in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:20:02 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:20:02 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":10110,"y":3728,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465595\n<hr>\n<p>Thatâs not what Iâm saying.

But this linked article is mostly clickbait.</p>"},{"id":"59ddc681fc9369e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by AtlasBarfed in \"The Carrington Event of 1859 and the Potential for a âMiyake Eventâ\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4747.111990502676,"y":3534.3502968683265,"wires":[["12d5ffe586ab18e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465866\n<hr>\n<p>Sooo.... widespread rooftop solar would probably help the resilience of at least domestic power?</p>"},{"id":"35f24ef46f0aa812","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ejb999 in \"GitHub education pack requesting real name on public profile\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6610,"y":2540,"wires":[["5e5672764b47c3e3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465865\n<hr>\n<p>what kind of calculators support 2FA?</p>"},{"id":"a18c1a8e87bcff26","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by motohagiography in \"Spainâs Lessons for American Decline\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8608,"y":2132,"wires":[["2aba6593bc6d376a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465864\n<hr>\n<p>Beautifully polymathic.

The code, with comments, is 35 lines of C.<p>Meanwhile, the regexp engine in Ruby 3.2.2, not even including the Regexp class visible to the language, is ~20597 lines excluding the headers.<p>They are not reasonably comparable, of course. Pike's code provides a very basic syntax which doesn't even support character classes, and does nothing to speed up the matching. The latter supports a very much more complex syntax, <i>and</i> is far faster for repeated or long matches.<p>But while Ruby's regexp engine is 588 times large than Pike's code, you of course get a vastly higher boost in overall system capability from those first 35 lines of code (from no regexp matching to some regexp matching) than the last 35 lines of code, or indeed the second 35 lines.<p>So if you have a small system and a small team, you work with that and start small and it won't be that surprising when you get a lot done in few lines of code, even though you have a long list of things you'll add when you can justify the extra resources (like those missing language classes, and a billion other features)<p>(Then you get a larger system, and you'll very soon find yourself wondering how you could manage with so little)<p>I think it's mostly surprising because most developers today aren't <i>used</i> to thinking about capacity constraints of small systems, and so starts designing for lots of features from the start (can't have regexps without character classes, and capture groups, and back-references, and ...).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/be...</a></p>"},{"id":"a2a0bf6cd32ff8ce","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by MrBuddyCasino in \"Removing Garbage Collection from the Rust Language (2013)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2420,"y":1860,"wires":[["5d148feff2f0c6f1"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465908\n<hr>\n<p>Tried Kotlin native?<p>- sum types via sealed classes (not great, admittedly)<p>- enum \"when\" expressions are exhaustive<p>- option type via built-in nullable types (honestly the superior solution)</p>"},{"id":"df79f4bee74b3d7a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by nobodyandproud in \"A guy preserving the new history of PC games, one Linux port at a time\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":10130,"y":3784,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465907\n<hr>\n<p>SteamOS came was indeed a failure, but I would have said it would fail in 2015.<p>Steamdeck, however, came out last year and it was a sensible choice by Valve to support Wine and Proton.<p>Youâre still thinking of Linux as a full OS and Platform, but Wine in 2023 makes Linux (or at least Steamdeck) as another device driver.<p>Steamdeck is also a poor platform for PC gaming which is why even Microsoft is getting involved, because PC gaming is a drop in the bucket compared to handheld and mobile.<p>If Valve remains committed with dedicated hardware and marketingâ-and this is a big ifâthen it becomes another power console and platform<p>The difference here is maybe Linux will get some of the crumbs and benefits.</p>"},{"id":"c180e9e7813dacb1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by rickdeckard in \"The End of Cheap Europe Flights?
