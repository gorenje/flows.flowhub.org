the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8050.440716826136,"y":420.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7438.440716826136,"y":2268.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4598.440716826136,"y":3028.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

stalls out, I have to play hot potato over their incredibly long list of available exit nodes just to try and find one that will work for another 5-10 minutes before I lose connection again.<p>Maybe

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

I simply don't understand who would want to buy any of the currently available players because they'll are so terrible to <i>use</i>.  The good ones were killed off by a combination of streaming services and Android devices. There are no more light-weight, simple players with high capacity, physical buttons and good battery life. You know, the kind of thing you could put into your pocket take on your run without bruising yourself. The kind of thing that has a legible screen, sane menu layout, that can read tags from your files and let you simply drag playlists into them. I know that there are people who want these things, but manufacturers are instead releasing gigantic bricks with protruding knobs and weird edges, huge battery-draining touch screens, running some dreadful Android hack of an OS. Reviews rarely discuss the most important aspects of a <i>portable</i> music device, and instead gush like wine critics about the ... I don't know, <i>smell</i>(?) or <i>taste</i>(?) of the music. I'm only half joking. The more prestigious the reviewer the more bollocks they write, and half the time I can't even find mention of the weight or size. Or when they do, they're plain wrong (eg: \"The Shanling Q1 is a light weight portable device\"... No it's f*cking not, it's an awful brick with a shitty OS, bad battery life, overly sensitive buttons. I don't care how well it sounds if I can't get playlists into it and don't want to use it because it's a heavy blob with a shitty interface.<p>15 years ago Rockbox on the Sansa Clip+ was great. If we could simply produce that with today's tech I'd take it in front of any of these ludicrous hulking house-bricks that cost an arm and a leg.</p>"},{"id":"3fb8542c03ffcc96","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by hot_gril in \"Peredvizhnikov Engine is a fully lock-free game engine written in C++20\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:09:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:09:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6904.440716826136,"y":2688.3615977627937,"wires":[["ecac6b4756c08597"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460607\n<hr>\n<p>For game dev or in general?

In particular, it's not the best approximation to a circular arc, which by most reasonable definitions is the smoothest possible curve. I did the math[1] and found that there's a parabola around each endpoint that <i>does</i> result in an accurate arc approximation, and in fact may be easier to apply as it doesn't move around as the length of the curve changes. Rather, each of the parabolas can be applied independently.<p>Evidence in favor of this is O(n^5) accuracy scaling to approximate Euler spirals (which are also a good candidate for \"smoothest possible curve\" depending on the way you define that). I suspect, but haven't yet demonstrated, that there's some variational sense in which this choice is optimum, or at least to a first order approximation.<p>You can think of cubic Béziers as forming a four-dimensional parameter space (the parameters can be accounted as the lengths and angles of the control handles; in this scheme, the positions of the endpoints are not counted). By applying a rule such as 1/3 arc length, or falling on a parabola, that reduces it to a two-dimensional space (same dimensionality as quadratic Beziers, Euler spirals, and sections of rectangular elastica). I think two dimensions is too few, as it doesn't give you the ability to easily form superellipse shapes, a particular strength of cubic Béziers and quite handy for font design, as superellipse is extremely useful. I think there may be some value in exploring a three-dimensional parameter space (which, among other things, is the count for general elastica) and have some ideas.<p>As for (2), the problem is that for s-shaped curves, cubic Béziers tend to put curvature maxima <i>near</i> but not exactly <i>on</i> endpoints. Since the curvature maximum is visually salient, you do better subdividing your curves so you can place them at joins. Other curve families, notably those based on elastica and Euler spirals, don't have this problem.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2021/02/19/parallel-curves.html#euler-spirals-to-cubic-b%C3%A9ziers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2021/02/19/parallel-curve...</a></p>"},{"id":"a32f910986456090","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by lambrospetrou in \"How to pass the interview for software engineering roles in Big Tech\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:24:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:24:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2643,"y":3430,"wires":[["b2b159db30507ce"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460743\n<hr>\n<p>I am the author :)<p>>I can only assume the author has not interviewed many candidates.<p>I did more than 100 interviews so far.<p>>I've lost count of how many tenured engineers I've interviewed who could not write basic code or explain basic programming concepts.

First, most developers never really learn metaprogramming or use it, even in languages with native facilities for it. You don't need it to get the job done, strictly speaking, and it is a difficult skill to acquire. Second, many software applications don't benefit that much from metaprogramming even when you have those skills. The benefits aren't universal, which brings the costs into question.<p>Nonetheless, for some types of software, writing code without using metaprogramming will have several-fold the LoC, complexity, etc of the equivalent <i>with</i> metaprogramming. But if you never developed metaprogramming skills, you are unlikely to recognize when these opportunities arise. In these cases, you do see large productivity multipliers. I see this pattern all the time in C++; most C++ developers have no idea how much concision (and type safety) metaprogramming enables in contexts where it is perfectly suited for the job because they never learned metaprogramming in C++, so they write vast amounts of brittle boilerplate instead.<p>I've used metaprogramming in enough languages and contexts to recognize it as solving a broad class of problems in a general way, but you still want to pick your moments because it isn't free. Similarly, garbage collection is the right choice for many software applications but it isn't free and there are contexts in which garbage collection introduces far more complexity than is justified by the benefits.<p>Recognizing these situations and being able to take advantage of them is a market opportunity.</p>"},{"id":"4ab8016a409c5a47","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Klonoar in \"Important types of pizza in America\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:34:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:34:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4598.440716826136,"y":2972.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460808\n<hr>\n<p>I will echo your sentiment even with the obvious caveat of “this may not apply to everyone everywhere so please avoid the obligatory well-actually response”.<p>It’s just a social wave/trend, it’ll pass in a few years and suddenly everyone will love pineapple on pizza again.

Scaling something up will always have side effects... in the case of too dense urban areas, it's for example the sheer amount of traffic. For example, a quarter full of high-rises, no way you can get away without expensive high-capacity subterranian trains to handle commuters, and surface traffic is going to be a hot mess even with just shuttling the basic supplies for supermarkets, restaurants and the likes in one direction and waste on the other direction. In contrast, even a standard European mid-sized city can get away with cheap bus and tram lines. And it's harder to provide other essentials to meaningful life in a city as well, particularly where children are involved - land is too valuable to leave it as a park, and children can't have outdoor places to play either in kindergarten because it's too expensive, so you have <i>even more</i> traffic just from parents bringing their kids to kindergarten/school/playgrounds/whatnot.<p>Another effect of urban over-density that's often neglected is human health, both physical (we've seen that with COVID, just how fast pathogens can spread in urban areas) and mental. I mean, even here in Munich or Berlin we're not at the US levels of mental health and housing issues with people defecating on the sidewalk, but still it's noticeable how cities tend to have more anti-social behavior, as poverty and boredom are definitely contagious especially when not backed by the implicit social control that life even in smaller cities brings.</p>"},{"id":"8a25b3cfd9eada97","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by wruza in \"Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:44:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:44:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6302.440716826136,"y":3300.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460862\n<hr>\n<p>It feels anxiety inducing at first, but if you have good controls and monitoring in place, it becomes daily routine.

This isn't bad per se, but it does mean that greater efficiency will not lead to reduced usage.<p>Nuclear power is one of our best current options, even though it's often derided for cost. But in lots of ways, we can't stop developing nations from burning fossil fuels, so energy developed nations produce from other sources can be use to capture those emissions.</p>"},{"id":"c2661dfcb88a68e7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by qeternity in \"Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:16:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:16:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5774.440716826136,"y":3412.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461055\n<hr>\n<p>> Selling options is also like that.<p>There are plenty of bad options traders, particularly retail...but this is an oversimplification.

This seems misleading to me.

(For example it is also illegal to hike or camp off-trail.)<p>This is only tenable if there are a large amount of public bathrooms available, otherwise tourists would just ignore the law. So Iceland has a disproportionate amount of bathrooms for conservation reasons.<p>It is even more misleading because many of these bathrooms driving around cost a small fee (200ISK) to use even though they are “public”, I.e. owned by the government and available to everyone.

Derivatives are useful when they stay constant over a stretch of time; when derivatives vary too much, it becomes more efficient to use more points of lower degree. This is the same calculation in other domains of approximation: numerical integration, DiffEq, and Taylor series.<p>For example, to draw rough surfaces, point-to-point lines are the most efficient way, with a ton of points. For industrial geometric shapes, lines and ellipses become efficient. As the smoothness of the curve goes up, more derivatives become valid. But sometimes those higher derivatives are not useful.<p>This is why the parent comment likes the Pencil tool; it's optimal for high variation, because it is a local (smoothed) control of position, the zeroth derivative. The cost is some loss of smoothness, which likely doesn't matter for her domain, since her hands move smoothly enough.<p>I think the Pen tool would be a more competitive alternative with a better control scheme. For example, a Pen tool with local control would unify the Pencil and Pen: letting you draw jagged curves by holding your mouse down, and letting you draw straight lines and smooth curves by clicking. There would be no interruption of flow, as you can use either method freely to continue a curve. They should inherently be the same tool anyway, just with different numbers of derivatives.</p>"},{"id":"aab208635a48eb99","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by pierat in \"Signs of the Zodiac: The Dendera Dating Controversy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:25:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:25:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7638.440716826136,"y":3524.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461109\n<hr>\n<p>Btw, Jews are not the problem.

They'd mainly be at LAN-parties to collect tools and meet other coders. Sometimes they'd show some cool demos they worked on, or some game they were working on<p>- Shared folders of music, films, and pictures would get copied an masse. A LOT of the pictures were definitely <i>not</i> for the public eye.<p>- Some LAN-parties would drag on for weeks, and kind of just become LAN-clubs. People would practically live there...I remember a friend hosted one of the last LAN-parties right around the time World of Warcraft got released, and while it was meant to just last for a weekend, 5-6 guys ended up staying there for a solid month, gaming WoW since the host had high-speed internet. Owner didn't mind, as he was equally hooked on the game.<p>- The older games would only play Age of Empires, and not much else. The competitive gamers would grind StarCraft, and later on CS.<p>- Playing all the pre 1.6 CS versions was a fun time. They seemed to change quite a bit between each update, until 1.6 became the standard.<p>- If we encountered some networking problems, someone always knew a 40-year old networking dude that would gladly show up and fix whatever was needed. Same dudes would always have tons of spare parts lying around.<p>- Right around the time CS 1.6 became popular, we started seeing the first \"pro\" gaming e-sports teams. Back then, these teams would just play at LAN parties, and then go compete in larger regional LAN parties. The prizes were laughable compared to the modern ones...one clan I knew won like $5000, which was split on 5-6 members? Those guys decided to drop out of school and pursue CS full-time, which lasted around 6 months or so.<p>- We would have a national LAN party in Hamar (The Gathering), and traveling there from all the way north was a real bitch. Imagine bringing a full-tower case and 19\" CRT onboard the plane. Even though the first flat-screens sucked, it was infinitely easier/more practical than those CRT screens.<p>And lots of other things.</p>"},{"id":"76d27da8dbfa37a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by aydyn in \"Lab-grown Meat is not a Climate Change Solution\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:33:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:33:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8714.440716826135,"y":3412.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461144\n<hr>\n<p>> Veganism is about not using animal products.
