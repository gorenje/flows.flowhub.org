I find setting up Nginx with an ACME tool very involved and painful. Inspired by Caddy's automatic HTTPS, I created something similar for Nginx. It mainly addresses the followings:<p>1. Nginx cannot have HTTPS configuration before the certificates are obtained. So you need to edit the configuration at least once, and also manually reload it after that.<p>2. Nginx and the ACME tool needs to agree on the location to read and write  ACME challenge answers. It can be error-prone.<p>3. Cron jobs have be set up to periodically renew the certificates and Nginx needs to be reloaded after that.<p>4. With the above drawbacks, provisioning an HTTPS web server in an automatic way is quite challenging.<p>With ACME Hugger, you sprinkle the Nginx configuration with a few ACME directives, and it will process the configuration, talk to an ACME server and run Nginx with a derived configuration, to handle all of the above automatically.<p>I hope others can find it useful too. Feedbacks are welcomed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469063\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469063</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments:

[1]  This essay’s bold claims about nvidia are like jetpac: something shortsighted, flashy, and designed to make Pete money.<p>Several flags in the essay:<p>“Machine learning is focused on training, not inference”  Nope!  There are many start-ups that do large-scale inference in the cloud, and have been long before Transformers existed.  Some of said companies are customers of e.g. Roboflow and Determined.ai etc.  Sure it’s not Google-scale, as Pete has been in Tensorflow land for the past few years.<p>“Researchers have the Purchasing Power.”  False!  Some can afford a 2-GPU machine, but Pete’s employer and many other large companies have shifted the attention of researchers to problems that require large clusters.  It’s almost impossible to publish now (e.g. reproduce results and do something new) without Google’s network (hardware money and people) having a hand in it.<p>The rest of the essay outlines a thesis that an inference-focused product (where Pete invests himself) will disrupt nvidia.  Investors take note! Googler is almost done with his handcuffs!<p>There are many risks to nvidia’s moat (they failed to get Arm after all) but this piece is about Pete trying to find investors, not about Nvidia.<p>[1] e.g. <a href=\"https://petewarden.com/2018/05/28/why-you-need-to-improve-your-training-data-and-how-to-do-it/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://petewarden.com/2018/05/28/why-you-need-to-improve-yo...</a>   Among others</p>"},{"id":"e53450878bbf585c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ksec in \"Nvidia’s AI supremacy is only temporary\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:15:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:15:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5940,"y":1888,"wires":[["9033fc872cd70470"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469458\n<hr>\n<p>Agree, But may be in the author's defence his conclusion is actually somewhat different to the title.<p>>If you believe my four predictions above, then it’s hard to escape the conclusion that Nvidia’s share of the overall AI market is going to drop.

wanting to use online format parsers to quickly decode that production JWT or decode a base64 Authorization header but cannot trust these websites to not leak my information. I thought to myself if only I could cut-off network access to this site, use it offline, and then throw away all browsing data. So I created an extension just for that.<p>It uses Firefox contextual identities API (Containers) to isolate browsing data and inter-tab communication. Once the site is fully loaded, I then inject bogus proxy settings for any requests leaving that container to effectively cut-off network access. And once I'm done, I simply delete the Container.<p>Use Cases:<p>* Parse a live JWT token<p>* Convert a Base64 Authorization header<p>* Hash a password<p>* Parse a Protobuf message<p>* Submit my name and birthdate to estimate my date of death<p>Check out the MIT source code on GitHub [1] and install QuaranTab from the Firefox store [2]. If anyone is interested in a discussion, I'd love to chat about:<p>1. Any ideas on how we could implement this in Chromium? Using private window as a \"Container\"?<p>2. Can you come up with an exploit? I posted a 100usd bug bounty [3] if you find one!<p>3. Is there any way to prove an extension in the store was built from source in GitHub?

Their business has gone downhill significantly in the past 5 years or so.<p>The MFA is a joke. I recovered a client's MFA myself with almost no effort. It worked out since didn't properly set up MFA anyway and needed to get it unlocked and set up correctly, but I was shocked how easy it was to pretend to be someone with them. They disabled someone else's MFA with only me confirming a DNS record (which i looked up publicly using dig), plus the name and password of the account. It was scary easy.<p>At one point many years back they decided to stop supporting Authy as their MFA provider and tried to move everyone to their namecheap app, which would be used as a second factor. But the app was so terribly broken and I got locked out of my account multiple times because the app would crash on newer iPhones for a while, so I couldn't access my account. This must have been super common because they disabled MFA for me by just confirming a code sent to my phone. I assume this was a widespread problem and they might have eased up MFA deactivation rules for a time since there were probably a lot of people locked out of accounts.<p>Luckily now, they use mainstream 2FA codes, so you can use any app you want. But the process has already scarred me.<p>Overall, Namecheap has deteriorated to all the problems that Godaddy orginally had. The bait-and-switch renewal prices, clunky UI, slower nameservers, and upsells upsells everywhere for email hosting and everything else.<p>So after about 15 years of namecheap, I will be finding a new home sometime this year for all my domains.</p>"},{"id":"5a4c28ec4bb9e05e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by 0xffff2 in \"Deep dive into the UK air traffic control meltdown\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:20:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:20:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7238,"y":3784,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469532\n<hr>\n<p>Broadly speaking I think this is done for new systems.

wanting to use online format parsers to quickly decode that production JWT or decode a base64 Authorization header but cannot trust these websites to not leak my information. I thought to myself if only I could cut-off network access to this site, use it offline, and then throw away all browsing data. So I created an extension just for that.<p>It uses Firefox contextual identities API (Containers) to isolate browsing data and inter-tab communication. Once the site is fully loaded, I then inject bogus proxy settings for any requests leaving that container to effectively cut-off network access. And once I'm done, I simply delete the Container.<p>Use Cases:<p>* Parse a live JWT token<p>* Convert a Base64 Authorization header<p>* Hash a password<p>* Parse a Protobuf message<p>* Submit my name and birthdate to estimate my date of death<p>Check out the MIT source code on GitHub [1] and install QuaranTab from the Firefox store [2]. If anyone is interested in a discussion, I'd love to chat about:<p>1. Any ideas on how we could implement this in Chromium? Using private window as a \"Container\"?<p>2. Can you come up with an exploit? I posted a 100usd bug bounty [3] if you find one!<p>3. Is there any way to prove an extension in the store was built from source in GitHub?

Buy buying your up front payments are higher than renting, but you pay the house off and long term pay less and thus need less to live on. Renting you have more free cash up front, but you need more  cash in the long run.<p>The above is the rule of thumb though.

Your affect on the bus number situation is compromised.<p>The 25k axiom is why I’m always trying to prioritize between concision and readability. It’s easier to hand off readable code, it’s easier to manage concise code. Concise code that is not readable is terse, so there’s a balancing act to be managed there.

To think of ways to improve bezier curves for vector graphics, you need to fully contextualize your thinking about the use case; this is not an academic mathematical discussion after all. Based on my understanding, your finding has no mathematical value as Pomax pointed it out, it is not new, it is an old math with a few constraints that is pre-defined, based on your assumption of what graphic artist wanted most of the time, which I agree is a good direction.<p>I highly suggest for anyone to try to make a better vector graphics tool, try to draw a letter S with the new approach as a test case, you can choose an existing font to match. And know existing vector graphics rules, here is a couple as example:\n- add anchor points at the horizontal and vertical extrema of your paths\n- control points should not cross path with one another\nCurves that doesn't follow these rules are valid, fine mathmatical curves, but graphic artists has practices this for years to rule out them as bad for the purpose of graphic design. Again, the goal is to find the more much smaller set of suitable curves from the infinite realm of mathematical possibilities, for the context of graphic design</p>"},{"id":"465c43ab66de725e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by michelangelo in \"Ksmbd (SMB3 Kernel Server) declared stable in Linux-6.6\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:09:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:09:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3136.581703316697,"y":4107.235617472237,"wires":[["d40b8885b76a4316"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37470270\n<hr>\n<p>Documentation: <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/next/filesystems/cifs/ksmbd.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.kernel.org/next/filesystems/cifs/ksmbd.html</a></p>"},{"id":"b31037e6a8ec24c5","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"You Don't Need UUID","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:41:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:41:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9006,"y":1712,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://henvic.dev/posts/uuid/\">https://henvic.dev/posts/uuid/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469857\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469857</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a4457cb7f353d4da","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by WirelessGigabit in \"The Rise and (Eventual) Fall of the SIM Card\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:15:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:15:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9062,"y":3952,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37470351\n<hr>\n<p>Mint.com: install app & sign in and load up the eSIM.<p>And that's the hard way.

The article is correct in saying inference, inference, inference.<p>The future of inference is smaller application and use-case specific models deployed to edge. Many of these applications just don’t work with the latency of networks to cloud. Imagine face tracking for a Snapchat filter if it involved streaming video to a cloud for inference. Yeah, not happening.<p>The hosting costs are also astronomical, big inference hardware is only getting harder to get and Nvidia only has so much manufacturing capacity.<p>Leave the H100s up to Meta, OpenAI, etc that are training massive multi-billion parameter LLMs from scratch. Or people renting them in small batches to do finetuning of “smaller” models, etc.<p>This is also getting chipped at - with the unified memory of Apple Silicon you can get the RAM of 2 A/H100s today for less than the cost of used 80GB A100s. With an entire computer (Mac Pro), new and under warranty.<p>Nvidia still wins on TFLOPS but expect M3/M4/whatever to close the gap on this by leaps and bounds. Again, not going up against Meta’s 15k H100s but all anyone else will ever need.<p>Back to the mobile/edge strategy, Xcode includes what is basically ML training and tuning functionality built in. You can literally train an object recognition model by dragging and dropping pictures, encrypt it, and bundle with your app all within Xcode. App developers are doing ML and barely even noticing. This is in latest Xcode, you can bet your bottom dollar Apple will be putting their significant resources to embracing all of this.<p>Train your model on your Mac, bundle it with your app, scale to infinitely for $0 in hosting costs because the model is running on the user’s device. No Nvidia in sight.<p>In terms of architecture you can still offload the big stuff to datacenter but at increasingly receding rates.<p>I personally think the capability and demand for ML/AI will quickly reach a point where Nvidia and clouds just cannot meet demand for the user base and breadth and scope of the functionality they will increasingly expect.<p>ChatGPT has an estimated 100 MAU. Very impressive but Snapchat alone is 1 billion. Capacity, hardware advancements, and the economics of “host everything on big Nvidia” just doesn’t work out.<p>Google has been putting TPU (lite) silicon  in Pixel devices since roughly 2021. Apple with neural engine since the iPhone X in 2017…<p>If you’ve been paying attention to these moves from Google and Apple over the last several years you would have seen this coming. They have not been caught flat-footed on this as so many people, press, etc think.<p>Granted there will always be demand for the big datacenter stuff and Nvidia won’t be hurting anytime soon but expect to see demand for Nvidia hardware and cloud GPU usage to drop more and more as this approach eats more and more.</p>"},{"id":"458b3b35ae58cf64","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by tavavex in \"Why Does Flying Suck So Much? – Robert Reich [video]\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:20:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:20:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7238,"y":4120,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37470430\n<hr>\n<p>> Disneyland-like Fast Passes, for TSA Scans<p>Is this an American-exclusive thing?

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"}]
