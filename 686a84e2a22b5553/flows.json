It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6234.440716826136,"y":724.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6902.440716826136,"y":2204.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4630.440716826136,"y":2644.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

stalls out, I have to play hot potato over their incredibly long list of available exit nodes just to try and find one that will work for another 5-10 minutes before I lose connection again.<p>Maybe

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

There's no way Khrushchev or the government as a whole wanted open war with the USSR, but maybe some did, and maybe some thought that they could prod Oswald into an assassination without getting caught.

When maximum torque is required, especially at low speeds, the magnetic field strength (B) should be maximum – so that inverter and motor currents are maintained at their lowest possible values. This minimizes the I² R (current² resistance) losses and thereby optimizes efficiency. Likewise, when torque levels are low, the B field should be reduced such that eddy and hysteresis losses due to B are also reduced. Ideally, B should be adjusted such that the sum of the eddy, hysteresis, and I² losses is minimized. Unfortunately, there is no easy way of changing B with permanent magnets.\n</code></pre>\nEssentially, this new tech combines the best of Permanent Magnet Brushless DC and Induction motors. It allows you to change the magnetic field B without contact.<p>The losses in the shaft coils are low when B is low so the gains in efficiency for an \"eco mode\" would be excellent as you modulate B for low torque and you would still retain the ability to crank up the power in a \"sport mode\" at the cost of efficiency.<p>[1]<a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-motors\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-mot...</a></p>"},{"id":"66010987e5160685","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by askonomm in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4630.440716826136,"y":3204.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458833\n<hr>\n<p>In Estonian motherboard is emaplaat.</p>"},{"id":"9f308a278c10dd36","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by weinzierl in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5370.440716826136,"y":1928.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458832\n<hr>\n<p>I always had a strong interest in security and that's the direction I developed even when still in automotive.

They'll say, \"I want a bridge about this long\" very nice, but but did you consider the about wind that whistles through this area ? Also, how many lanes? Yeah that many is too few because once this bridge goes up we're not gonna be reasonably able to close it even for maintenance. We need at least 4 lanes. Isn't there a cement shortage? Hm.. maybe we can use this material instead? No. I don't think building with wood for this length is a great idea.<p>You get the picture. Yes lead developers exist, but they only have so much time to do little battles and they're busy making sure the big things are arguing correctly.

It was the early 10s, and that's when the lan part of the lan party was truely dead. Everyone stopped playing TF2, and CS, and everyone moved to League of Legends.

In state-of-the-art electric vehicles there are basically three main machine topologies that are used for the main traction machine.<p>- Interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs): A large number of OEMs and suppliers use/supply this motor topology, e.g., General motors, Tesla model 3, Ford, etc.<p>- Induction machines (IMs): Also used by a large number of OEMs and suppliers, e.g., Tesla model S and X, G.M. for assist motors, etc.<p>- Wound field synchronous machines (WFSMs) [in Europe more commonly known as electrically excited synchronous machines (EESMs) but they are the same thing] - Currently used in Renault and some BMW models. A large number of suppliers are developing them.<p>Each of the machine topologies has tradeoffs compared to the others, cost, manufacturing CapEx, supply chain risk, drive cycle efficiency, difficulty of control, failure modes, cooling complexity, etc.<p>WFSMs or EESMs have some potential advantages over IPMSMs or IMs for some applications.<p>- They don't contain rare earth permanent magnets eliminating the supply chain and price volatility associated with them.<p>- In terms of drive cycle efficiency generally they are more efficient than IMs and if the drive cycle is dominated by moderate torques and highspeeds they can exceed the drive cycle efficiencies of IPMSMs.<p>- They are very easy to field weaken and theoretically can have an infinite constant power speed range.<p>- The field excitation can be controlled to provide unity power factor potentially allowing the stator inverter to be downsized.<p>The main negatives of WFSMs or EESMs compared to IPMSMs or IMs are:<p>- The field excitation is more complicated and requires power electronics either for brushes and slip rings or inductive power transfer approaches.<p>- The cooling of the field winding is difficult and typically spray/jet cooling of the end turns or at a minimum through shaft cooling.<p>- The control of WFSMs or EESMs is considerably more complicated than IPMSMs or IMs.</p>"},{"id":"aaf3199381c456ab","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Finnucane in \"Viagra Lowers the Risk of Alzheimer’s by Almost 70%, Study Finds\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4188.440716826136,"y":2656.3615977627937,"wires":[["5e3bfba726b1cbf9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459210\n<hr>\n<p>\"IF your ability to remember why you opened the fridge lasts more than 4 hours, call a doctor.\"</p>"},{"id":"39604504bf7adc","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by chiefalchemist in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1440.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459209\n<hr>\n<p>Trees also \"capture\" heat.

For instance a critical component to the conspiratorial view is Operation Northwoods [1]. And it tends to paint a far different than picture than you are claiming. Operation Northwoods was a planned CIA operation where they were going to carry out terrorist attacks against both civilian and military US targets (notably they even proposed the use of remote controlled civilian aircraft) and blame it on Cuba, so we could start a war with them. This plan successfully made its way all the way up the chain of the command and was one signature away from being executed. The problem is that JFK rejected it, vigorously.<p>The CIA and the military wanted global escalation and military conflict. Kennedy, by contrast, was working more towards reconciliation and global peace through good faith. Just prior to Operation Northwoods, he had recently removed the head of the CIA (following the Bay of Pigs catastrophe), and following the Joint Chief of Staffs presentation of Operation Northwoods to him, JFK also removed him from power as well. JFK would then go to on to pass a unilateral nuclear test ban as a show of good faith to the USSR, and was reportedly not only looking to withdraw from Vietnam, but also to completely dismantle the CIA. Less than 6 months later, he would be assassinated.<p>That's hardly a tale of some 'shadowy elite trying to control the world.' In fact it becomes the assassination becomes so utterly predictable in this context that one has to consider that if it was a simple lone-wolf then the CIA and military effectively won some sort of one in a quadrillion type lottery (at least from their rather sociopathic worldviews). For that assassin to then to be assassinated, after initially claiming he was a \"patsy\", and all the other weirdness around it all, I think Occam's Razor starts pointing in a pretty clear direction.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a></p>"},{"id":"710d9566b6dc07e3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ndsipa_pomu in \"Five billion people will face extreme heat at least a month each year by 2050\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:43:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:43:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3790.440716826136,"y":3308.3615977627937,"wires":[["d9a4d81b1c110dd3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459252\n<hr>\n<p>Are cold weather deaths increasing or predicted to increase significantly?

That's just bullshit to try pushing people against A/C.<p>Cities are hotter than outside because:<p>- they absorb more heat :: concrete, asphalt absorb much more than grass or trees and disperse far more slowly. Just go walking in a bush, measure temperature at 1.5 m from soil, do the same in grass covered area and the same over a road. You'll see and feel the difference;<p>- in cities there are MANY ICE vehicles whose engine produce much heat, much more than any electrical motor;<p>- in cities there is less air circulation than in the open nature due to the high and heat-absorbing buildings;<p>- in many cities glass coated skyscraper works like any other glass keeping much of Sun IR radiation inside.<p>These are the reason why cities are hotter. Another proof? They are ALSO hotter in winter, not just in summer. In winter you can count extra heat from badly insulated heated buildings, little cold pushed outside by the so far limited percentage of people heating with some heat pumps that have air on their exterior side, but look at the numbers and you'll see they are more hotter than mere heats spread outside by badly insulated heated buildings.<p>People should learn two things:<p>- cities WAS a necessity to evolve in the past, but with the '80 logistic revolution they lost one of their last reasons to exists, manufacturing became cheaper to do far from customers, so far from cities. With the remote work the last remaining reasons vanish as well. As a result dense cities and high rise buildings have NO REASONS TO EXISTS anymore. Try to keep them and sell them as green, good for the future etc is just a push toward intensive human farming to keep people dependent on service they don't own, living to operate them so they can pay them. Since in the modern era cities can't be sustained the push needs to makes people accept bad living condition as a new normal;<p>- we need to switch from a high density model, too dense for today state of tech and society, climate etc to a new less dense one, that's hard and that's means MANY will be simply \"overflowing humans\" to be put somewhere, since no one like that role, if told in such a crude way, some try to advertise such role with various \"bells and whistles\" but that's simply BULLSHIT.<p>If you try reasoning about the above you'll understand a thing: such move to put aside a significant percentage of humans can't really work, never worked in history. It does work if the set aside cohort is very limited, the poorest, very isolated and very dependent, but at modern scale can't work.</p>"},{"id":"da030e8df7c0c8d7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by OrsonSmelles in \"I wired up my bike's GPS to order me pizza during a gravel race\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:49:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:49:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1990,"y":1652,"wires":[["bb45ade057f478bf"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459304\n<hr>\n<p>I think I'm slightly more worried that photonicinduction has <i>actually died</i> when he goes silent for a while, though.

(Demo was a linear path with this ‘recovery’ hard coded)\n- Buy side: “yes absolutely we already integrate with X”. Queue 12 months of delays because they had never integrated with that platform before.<p>But, I think I get it. The deals are huge and you only sell a few a year. Once an enterprise commits, it is unlikely to switch vendors unless it goes really really bad. So, the salesperson that convincingly lies gets the deal, and surprisingly the downside is relatively limited.<p>OTOH, not massaging the truth might mean losing that deal. Huge downside, very limited upside. (Yes the buyer might be a bit more happy, but that likely doesn’t outweigh sometimes missing a multi million deal, unless buyer talk a lot with each other).</p>"},{"id":"66adcaaddd91ba97","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by fragmede in \"A Case for Simple UDP Load Balancing\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5918.440716826136,"y":1344.3615977627937,"wires":[["89c178ee5578dbb0"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459296\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"1a9e35a4d23f136f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by YeGoblynQueenne in \"Signs of the Zodiac: The Dendera Dating Controversy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5558.440716826136,"y":3820.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459295\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"3e7336436abf9ebc","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by WheatMillington in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:38 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:38 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1640.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459294\n<hr>\n<p>If you're replacing your gas every 2-4 years, something is terribly wrong.</p>"},{"id":"a0161fe88bcf264c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sethbannon in \"Mistakes You Should Never Make (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3494.440716826136,"y":3316.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459293\n<hr>\n<p>Post author here.
