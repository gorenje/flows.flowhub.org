to the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6874.440716826136,"y":444.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3046.440716826136,"y":2316.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6214.440716826136,"y":2988.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

stalls out, I have to play hot potato over their incredibly long list of available exit nodes just to try and find one that will work for another 5-10 minutes before I lose connection again.<p>Maybe

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

Why do you take the Warren Report as gospel?<p>“ Arlen Specter, who had traveled to Dallas to take Tomlinson’s deposition in March 1964, was thunderstruck when Tomlinson relayed this scenario. To judge from a transcript of that conversation, Specter spent much of the remainder of his time with Tomlinson essentially trying to talk him out of his recollection, causing a distressed Tomlinson to say he just was not sure about his memory.<p>But the Q&A itself clearly suggests that Tomlinson, unprompted and unbadgered, had a cogent recollection that a bullet, wherever else it ultimately ended up, had come from the stretcher that had already been left in the hall in front of the men’s room.<p>In its final report, the Warren Commission mentioned nothing about this detail from Tomlinson’s account. Instead, the panel largely dismissed Tomlinson’s testimony, writing that even though he was “not certain whether the bullet came from the Connally stretcher or the adjacent one,” the commission “has concluded that the bullet came from the Governor’s stretcher.”</p>"},{"id":"e015784b01a1a708","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by m3kw9 in \"Effectiveness of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:01:36 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:01:36 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3774.440716826136,"y":4044.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461295\n<hr>\n<p>Doesn’t do anything for me, it may serve as a clutch but you always fall back to average without any solid habit/life/situation changes</p>"},{"id":"d185e70e3e80b4ee","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by naveen99 in \"Effectiveness of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:01:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:01:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5978.440716826136,"y":4156.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461294\n<hr>\n<p>How about a mental activity tracker to increase mental activity ?

The amount of hydrogen ions someplace is what PH means, so controlling PH <i>is</i>  controlling the number of <i>hydrogen</i> ions.<p>The same thing happens with calcium, but rather than doing the buffering it’s the number of calcium ions being controlled.  Calcium buffering <i>is</i> controlling the number of <i>calcium</i> ions.<p>> Calcium buffering describes the processes which help stabilise the concentration of free calcium ions within cells, in a similar manner to how pH buffers maintain a stable concentration of hydrogen ions.[1] The majority of calcium ions within the cell are bound to intracellular proteins, leaving a minority freely dissociated.[2] When calcium is added to or removed from the cytoplasm by transport across the cell membrane or sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium buffers minimise the effect on changes in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration by binding calcium to or releasing calcium from intracellular proteins. As a result, 99% of the calcium added to the cytosol of a cardiomyocyte during each cardiac cycle becomes bound to calcium buffers, creating a relatively small change in free calcium.[2]</p>"},{"id":"2836c805b635d4ed","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by mellosouls in \"The New Clubhouse\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2793,"y":3230,"wires":[["abd0e5c3e3cc7f16"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461330\n<hr>\n<p>Clubhouse was never cool.</p>"},{"id":"718a1a2f1bfbc734","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Legend2440 in \"Improving NeRF quality by progressive camera placement\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5758.440716826136,"y":2124.3615977627937,"wires":[["63e39a55b1a18a8f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461329\n<hr>\n<p>Most techniques for nerfs also work for the newer variants like guassian splatting.<p>It's the same fundamental process - optimizing a 3D representation of a scene using gradient descent.

That's basically the same workflow as a notebook in my mind. Like I said this means there is a large class of tasks julia a doesn't make sense for because paying the startup cost is too expensive compared to python or go.<p>I just timed vscode with the lsp. From the point I open a 40 line file of the lorenz attractor example, it takes 45 seconds until navigation within that same file works, and the lsp hogs 1 GB of memory. That's 5x the memory of clangd and 20x worse performance; hardly what I would consider a snappy experience.<p>I have no doubt that julia can be shoe-horned into realtime applications. But when I read threads like this [1], it's pretty clear that doing so amounts to a hack (e.g., people recommending that you somehow call all your functions to get them jited before the main loop actually starts). Even the mitigations you propose, i.e., pre-allocating everything, don't exploit any guarantees made by the language, so you're basically in cross-your-fingers and pray territory.

I tried to understand what's actually going on. From the actual rule in the Federal Register (<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/30/2020-23765/energy-conservation-program-establishment-of-a-new-product-class-for-residential-dishwashers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/30/2020-23...</a>):<p>> Moreover, the current standard requires standard residential dishwashers to not exceed 307 kWh/year and 5.0 gallons per cycle for the “Normal” cycle. 10 CFR 430.32(f)(1)(i). Consistent with the results of the Department's evaluation of dishwashers offering a 60 to 90 minute “Quick” cycle, DOE's has identified an innovative opportunity for the further development of a dishwasher model offering a “Normal” cycle of one hour or less.<p>I <i>think</i> the issue is that manufacturers struggle to get good cleaning performance subject to the 307 kWh/year, 5 gallon per cycle rule unless the cycle is very slow, and the DOE has indicated that it will allow more water and/or more energy usage for faster dishwashers.<p>(Speaking of water usage, I find it odd that dishwashers don't seem to do a final spray with fresh (non-recirculated) water.  I would gladly use an extra 1/4 - 1/2 gallon per load to get a freshwater rinse at the end.<p>P.S. What's up with kWh/year anyway?  Surely it should be kWh per <i>cycle</i> with an added restriction on additional power used when not running.</p>"},{"id":"bd74248a08a6e86c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by peteradio in \"Small prey compelled prehistoric humans to produce appropriate hunting weapons\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:21:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:21:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7294.440716826136,"y":3216.3615977627937,"wires":[["89882ec70a33202a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461423\n<hr>\n<p>It's hard to understand how such a small population could have managed such an outsized ecological impact when we are several orders of magnitude more populace now.</p>"},{"id":"307acac54ee47c9f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by brundolf in \"Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5886.440716826136,"y":3372.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461421\n<hr>\n<p>Much as I love articles that reinforce my existing beliefs, high-frequency trading is a pretty extreme case when it comes to how how badly things can go in a short time</p>"},{"id":"232b488122406937","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by BurningFrog in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1120.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461420\n<hr>\n<p>Trees can shade one story houses, but hardly any multiple floor apartment buildings.<p>Which makes it a good solution only to <i>suburban</i> heating.</p>"},{"id":"ffaab77fa09cfe86","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by MichaelZuo in \"Why Socialism?

Toyota says they have it figured out but their new EVs aren't coming until 2028 model year (5 years!). But this kind of longer timeline also hides the failure of a lot of car makers to invest enough in the battery supply chain - they can't buy enough batteries or they are too expensive, so it's another excuse for what they want anyway, which is not to make that many EVs. They want to keep selling ICE cars while they can.<p>Look at GM and Ford, the GM ultium battery pack has unspecified problems with mass manufacturing, Ford has also slowed down manufacturing at times this cal year (to improve efficiency or something, specific reasons unclear). I still see the market dynamics being that (1) Tesla continues to take market share from legacy auto where ever they are on the market, and (2) Chinese companies will follow and be even more devastating, because they are making EVs in even larger quantities, decent quality and low prices.</p>"},{"id":"bd95686ccd4f2195","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jefftk in \"The New Clubhouse\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:25:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:25:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2793,"y":3270,"wires":[["abd0e5c3e3cc7f16"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461451\n<hr>\n<p>I don't interpret \"met at the park, talked for hours, became best friends and fell in love\" as all taking place on the first date?</p>"},{"id":"d027731efcd923b1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by XorNot in \"Mystery 'golden egg' found on ocean floor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:25:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:25:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6882.440716826136,"y":3204.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461450\n<hr>\n<p>How else do you imagine that thing came into existence?</p>"},{"id":"662e1332f5343eff","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by kiririn in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:24:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:24:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1240.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461448\n<hr>\n<p>If the outside temperature is lower than inside then single hose is at least as good, as long as you open a window somewhere else so outside air rather than some other apartment’s air is sucked in</p>"},{"id":"31201f78c5993d2f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by gerdesj in \"Small prey compelled prehistoric humans to produce appropriate hunting weapons\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:24:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:24:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7294.440716826136,"y":3256.3615977627937,"wires":[["89882ec70a33202a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461447\n<hr>\n<p>\"But one may well ask: Why did humans become smarter all of a sudden?

The world of <i>enterprise</i> SaaS follows a different business model that I refer to as «hiding the dead horse in the cloud» and holding the customer to ransom.<p>The premise: the customer is already locked into the wares the vendor supplies, and the customer can't easily migrate away from the product. Oftentimes, the product is also ridden with the technical debt, but it either has a feature critical to the business or there are multiple business (and technical) processes that have a deeply ingrained reliance on the product. It is either the data or the integration with the product. Regularly both.<p>The vendor repackages the product («the dead horse») as a SaaS, rolls it out into the cloud (the act of hiding the said dead horse), bumps prices up and slips the bill under the customer's front door (the ransom). Cloud costs are passed onto the customer at a markup. The product (and sometimes the customer) might get minor tangible benefits from the repackaged version, e.g. improved availability and reliability, although even that is not always the case. SaaS products typically do not use native cloud services, they run on EC2 instances (or their equivalent in Azure, less often GCP) and are cobbled together just enough to make them not fall apart.<p>SaaS, as a business model, is not about the engineering excellence most of the time. It is about squeezing the last drop of blood that there is left in a legacy product, now being offered as a shiny-shiny SaaS version («hey, lookie, we are also int the cloud!»). This is the reality.<p>The theory is somewhat different. In between 2000s and 2020 (approximately), vendors used to tailor their products to specific needs of each specific customer which increasingly became difficult to maintain, update and upgrade as there would be no single product titled «ABC», there would a «ABC customised/hand-rolled for customer 123», «ABC customised/hand-rolled for customer 456» and so forth. So the original premise of SaaS was to have a single version of the product for ALL customers that exposes simple data centric and whatever other technical interfaces that the customer would hook into. The enterprise world does not work that way, though.<p>There are positive exceptions in the world of SaaS, and almost all of them are in the startup universe and outside the enterprise.</p>"},{"id":"fdfb5fecf4c75cd3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by thsksbd in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:28:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:28:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5250.440716826136,"y":2100.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461465\n<hr>\n<p>You extraoolated a lot about myself from an explanation of what constitutes a machine's personality.<p>For starteds, I wouldn't call the Golf cheap.

You have one family member that is training regularly for 5ks, half-marathons, marathons, etc and its always nice to just be able to get anywhere close to their steps for the week. Have a friend that you usually can beat, all of a sudden you're encouraged to hop on the treadmill and get an extra 1000 steps in that day. Theres a poor alternative called Stridekick, that seems to check all the boxes as a replacement, but just somehow is just poorly designed enough to be an app no one actually wants to use.<p>Now they've issued an update that is bricking Fitbit devices and are just sending out coupons to buy a new one.<p>Whats frustrating is that the market seems completely devoid of anything currently to replace them. All the halfway decent options are all huge clunky smartwatches. If you have no interest in apps on your wrist, because you already own a phone, it seems like the only option is the ugliest Garmin I've ever seen or Chinese ones of unknown quality that do not connect to any of the fitness ecosystem. When my FitBit seemingly got hit with a bug that killed it, (worked fine one day, then suddenly battery only lasted an hour after just over a year of owning it), I desperately looked for an alternative and ended up stuck getting the cheapest FitBit. It really wasn't an option to forgo not having a device as my insurance pays me up to 90 bucks a month for hitting my step goals.</p>"},{"id":"6918f77fd4e6d949","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Veserv in \"Our Self-Driving Cars Will Save Lives, but They Will Kill Some of You First\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:46:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:46:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4502.440716826136,"y":4100.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461554\n<hr>\n<p>So if you safety processes made 99% of situations 1,000,000 times safer, but 1% of situations remain high risk you may as well throw out all your processes and incur 1,000,000 times more risk 100% of the time?<p>That is positively absurd.<p>It might make sense to reevaluate what is the most efficient allocation of resources which would result in the greatest holistic safety increase per resource spent, but throwing everything out to reach the lowest common denominator is just straight up nonsense.<p>The only way that makes sense is if you assume a completely uniform risk tolerance, completely uniform mitigation ROI, and you assume the highest risk activity is the true underlying uniform risk tolerance with the other 99% of low risk activities being the outliers.

User Danwills mentions color spaces, which are the means by which colour is expressed and also the means by which color is 'transcribed' from one device to another. For this I would highly recommend Kuehni, R.: Color Space and its Divisions: Color Order from Antiquity to the Present. Wiley-Interscience, 2003. A great read.<p>It sounds as if you have an interest in the aesthetic application of colour. The standard tomes are Itten's The Art of Colour and Goethe's Colour Theory. In my opinion, both of them are semi-incoherent messes that have done more harm than good to painters. Bruce McEvoy's website 'Handprint' evidences a man who knows more about colour that Itten ever did.   \n<a href=\"https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/water.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/water.html</a> Its good to see that he is finally getting round to writing a book.<p>The way I teach color application to my students is broadly as follows.<p>Firstly, the 'thinking' color space for an artist (digital or traditional) should be Hue, Saturation and Lightness (HSL). Using these values the colors of  an aesthetic image can be 'conceptually disassembled'. To demonstrate this, I ask my students to describe the colors they are each wearing in terms of pairwise comparisons of HSL (e.g. 'A' is the same saturation as 'B' but of a different hue and slightly lighter).<p>For lightness, the simple rule of thumb is to ensure that the tones are approximately separate into three bands: light, middle dark (LMD). To this one might add black and white as the top and tail. Of courses, there is not an absolute rule, and without even blinking I could show you painters who have successfully employed only two-tone bands. Novices tend to overload the lower end of the tonal range. To demonstrate tone organization, I draw a posterise curve on Photoshop's Curves. It is important to know that the M of LMD is not absolute (with M as 50% with 0 as black), but instead tends to lay around 40%. It can also be observed that most paintings extend from black to white. However, again without even trying I could name a dozen exceptions (for example, check out the low tonal range of some of Gwen John's painting).<p>Saturation is the intensity half of the chromatic component of colour. In common with lightness, it exists as a 'ramp' value bound by a min and max.  For this reason, it can mostly be treated in much the same way as lightness. For most of art history, the saturation map of a painting followed its lightness map. It was the development of the chemical and dying industry in France that introduced artists to a wider range of intense pigments. The saturation map of Gericault's Still Life with Lobsters is remarkably different to its lightness map. If you don't have access of MATLAB or Nuke or suchlike, you can make a saturation map in Photoshop using the Selective Colour adjustment. Just cycle through the colours in the drop-down menu and set the black value of each one to -100%. For the white, neutral and black, set the black value to +100%. Seeing the saturation of a painting expressed in this way is something that the impressionists would have murdered for.<p>Hue is the difficult beast in the HSL triumvirate. To get a grip on it you have to side-step into the RYB colour space. It is in the RYB colour wheel that the hues are arranged in their perceptually antagonistic pairings: red/green, yellow/purple, blue/orange. These pairings have been know for 100s of years, even before Newton's colour wheel was a thing. It is uniquely difficult to get a handle on hue... it defies easy conceptualisation. There is also a huge amount of bullshit in the wild on the subject of hue. Check out adobe's colour wheel: color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel See all that stuff about triadic complementary etc? Most of it is mostly hot air. How do I know? I have personally reviewed the hue histogram of hundreds of paintings. From this I can say that the organisational strategies that artists employ are, at best, approximate. Certainly, they are not as clear as the art books tell us. However, the following is generally true... painters avoid: hues that span no more than one half of the RYB hue wheel, hue that are evenly distributed on two halves of the RYB hue wheel, hue that occupies 360 degrees of the RYB hue wheel.<p>The final key wisdom that I expect of my students is to understand contrast as a structural phenomenon. This can be understood as manifesting in two (main) ways. The first is ratio contrast, which is simply the contrast between two values. In painting, these values are usually averages. Separately considered can be the contrast between neighbouring regions and those which are not. The former are perceptually prime and can overwhelm our ability to perceive those regions which are distant to each other. The second contrast is global contrast. An image which extends from black to white has higher global contrast that one which extends from dark grey to light grey. These two ways of understanding colour contrast can be extended in many dimentions. For example, the way that they manifest between (ratio) and within (global) the depth planes of a landscape.<p>As for what constitutes effective colour contrast: one observation holds true of all painters, writers, filmmakers etc.: that their task is to exaggerate life. This they do in two dimensions: exaggeration of difference and exaggeration of similarity (though Ruskin expressed this as a difference between affinity and contrast).</p>"},{"id":"4ca99650c2f03595","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by throw10902023 in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:56:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:56:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6986.440716826136,"y":4492.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461618\n<hr>\n<p>Define conspiracy theory.

He agrees with MMT (both theorists and most of the MMT-influenced policy activists) that the only real constraints on fiscal policy are monetary effects (the positions most MMT critics take issue with), but disagrees with (what he sees as the position of) MMT theorists on traditional monetary policy being ineffective at its monetary goals. I'm not familiar with the source work in MMT to know if the position he takes issue with is actually the position of MMT theorists, but I'm familiar enough with the less academic policy advocates associated with the MMT movement that I've always considered their advocacy to be in line with orthodox Keynesianism more than even most policy advocates who rhetorically are Keynesian, because the latter tend to -- despite embracing the positions which clearly make it out to be a false constraint -- adhere rather strongly to the preference that the government play-act as if the finite public purse (the \"fisc\") were a real thing outside of the domain of monetary policy, though they'll embrace things like countercyclical deficits, whereas MMT-influenced advocates tend to embrace that a fiat currency budget doesn't have a fisc and is constrained only by the monetary effects of the money it creates by spending and destroys by taxing.<p>But these MMT-influenced advocates don't generally advocate around the view of the uselessness of traditional monetary policy as currently entrusted to the Fed that Krugman takes issue with; they tend to prefer using traditional fiscal policy within its monetary constraints more actively for the purposes of traditional monetary policy because its easier to fine-tune the distributional impacts within the aggregate target, not because the Fed controlling rates doesn't work for macro-level monetary functions. So, in a sense, <i>academic</i> MMT may be a different thing that <i>policy-world</i> MMT, with the latter being mostly Keynsianism without fiscal policy cosplaying a commodity money constraint in a fiat money system.</p>"},{"id":"e1d62f0a9ed8058d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by SoftTalker in \"Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:07:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:07:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7162.440716826136,"y":3540.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461685\n<hr>\n<p>Early theory about the cause (incorrect, as it turns out):<p><i>Nanex ~ 03-Aug-2012 ~ The Knightmare Explaned</i> - <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4337359\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4337359</a> (no comments)</p>"},{"id":"13ce95cbeb00d67d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by eurticket in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:07:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:07:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6686.440716826136,"y":4100.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461684\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"24f51d589d80c02e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jcparkyn in \"I wrote a string type\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3862.440716826136,"y":1756.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461683\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"a60aeedaad1f01f4","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by rstat1 in \"Peredvizhnikov Engine: Lock-free game engine written in C++20\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3714.440716826136,"y":3876.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461681\n<hr>\n<p>Also borrows the whole of its compositor \"nvnflinger\" from Android's \"SurfaceFlinger\".<p>I'd call that a pretty significant piece.</p>"},{"id":"a0a2ea5652feee2f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by JPws_Prntr_Fngr in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5410.440716826136,"y":4548.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461680\n<hr>\n<p>+1. <i>The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War</i> is a great complimentary biopic.</p>"},{"id":"5776a60fa4b3b812","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by satvikpendem in \"The New Clubhouse\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:06:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2793,"y":3630,"wires":[["abd0e5c3e3cc7f16"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461679\n<hr>\n<p>I don't use stories but I often use their Reels feature.

The one exception is \"emergencies,\" but when I asked it seems this is basically only the ER.<p>I believe you can get out-of-state covered via out-of-network. But as mentioned, the out-of-pocket max on my plan is shockingly ~6x more for out-of-network than in-network. So you won't pay 90% of $200k, but it will still end up a very substantial amount. But maybe that could still be worth it to see an out-of-state specialist?</p>"},{"id":"ed0d674a33d96dd2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by dylan604 in \"Mystery 'golden egg' found on ocean floor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:30:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 01:30:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2443.8210571452637,"y":4134.274416265135,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461810\n<hr>\n<p>Or just decide that you did re-watch it, and everyone will be convinced you did</p>"},{"id":"82408bc0eff8dab1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by bryanlarsen in \"To make dishwashers great again?
