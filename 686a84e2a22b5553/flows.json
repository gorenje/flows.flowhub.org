It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7190.440716826136,"y":716.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6870.440716826136,"y":2204.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4598.440716826136,"y":2644.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

from a business standpoint.  Ad-supported sites could say \"we currently have no better business model than advertising, but we could make the ads less terrible if you help\".<p>Nobody does this because the trust is completely gone.  If you claim \"we can offer you crappy ads or better ads\", nobody really believes you'll do that, and there are some very dubious definitions of \"better ads\".  So people demand the financially impossible, \"no ads\".<p>There's also a lot more hostility towards internet ads than other media, in part because trust was broken very early on.  Bad internet ads are a lot worse than bad traditional-media ads.  Other media had effective limits on how obnoxious an ad could be: if you accidentally lingered your eye over the Kroger ad in the newspaper, it didn't expand and crowd out the latest Covid statistics.  The injury-lawyer ad on TV couldn't provide a vector for a zero-day that permanently dialed your set to Telemundo.  I also suspect there was a lot more \"ad curation\" in legacy media-- the ad choice still reflected on the publisher, and the cost of entry was high enough to filter out some of the most scammy ads.  (Could you pull off the \"Punch the monkey and win a PS3\" scam if you had to pay for high-quality print ads?)  The result: people who never hit the \"30 second skip\" button on their VCR remote are intimately familiar with uBlock Origin.</p>"},{"id":"356e8acbf0979e76","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by retSava in \"A Texas Semiconductor Boom on the Horizon\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:27:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:27:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1180.9224623660107,"y":4473.3439703426575,"wires":[["cabb637cf3b7519c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457998\n<hr>\n<p>It's also exactly the kind of humor I love.

I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

The major concern with Nuclear is the <i>economic cost</i> of accidents not the deaths. Grid solar is by far the safest option per kWh, but we still subsidize relatively deadly rooftop solar because such low numbers of deaths aren’t a major concern for regulators.<p>Next both Nuclear and solar/wind want storage/dispatchable power to follow the daily, weekly, and yearly demand curve. Hydro can provide significant flexibility but scaling Nuclear means falling capacity factors mean higher cost per kWh.<p>As to battery backed solar, there’s several existing power plants that operate with the ability to store 40-50% of their daily generation capacity that are viable with current grid prices.  Significant renewable storage is therefore already cost effective as long as the source electricity is cheap enough.<p>Finally regulations don’t really explain the price differences alone when you compare different countries and they all have similar issues you need to look deeper. One example of a root issues is modern skilled workers simply demand higher salaries. Most industries have offset this with  higher levels of productivity and or outsourcing, but the Nuclear industry has completely failed here.<p>In theory many of these issues could be addressed, but current plans fail to do so in fundamental ways.

And to be honest, if it wasn't for the internet - made up of personal websites and real people sharing their own experience on forums - that taught me everything there is to know about Cluster B disordered personalities (just an example, <i>cough</i> nothing personal <i>cough</i>), I don't think I would be sitting here typing this lengthy response.<p>I realized I can not sit back, enjoy the decline of the internet, and only complain about it.

According to this article, caps and lids made out of plastic may be placed on the market only if the caps and lids remain attached to the containers during the products’ intended use stage. Tethered caps will become mandatory in the EU in July 2024.<p>Why is this a thing? Because plastic lids are made of a harder plastic that doesn't degrade as quickly and is much less recycled than the bottles themselves. How prevalent is this? In the last 30 years 20 million bottle caps have been found on beaches alone in Europe during clean-up work. They are in the top 5 ocean trash items that ultimately kill wildlife. This is only a small snapshot of the ultimate number of bottle caps not recycled aside their bottles.<p>To fix this, the EU suggest tethering the lid to the bottle so they're less easily lost and more likely to be recycled properly. 20 companies are responsible for the majority of throwaway plastics in the world, so this change is required in only a few places but could have a large net-benefit. Ultimately this is something that can only come from top-down optimization - why? Because it increases costs for each bottle.<p>> This new bottle cap design requirement must have created a new economy for producing these bottle caps for all of the containers, someone profited.<p>Companies lost money from this and tried to lobby to avoid it by trying ideas first, and then tethering if those failed.<p>> There are massive problems around waste that no one there dares to approach, so they make these weird directives that just smell of corruption and incompetence.<p>Why can't we tackle the small and the large?<p>> Many cities, to avoid fines, provide separate containers, but in the end just throw everything on the same pile.<p>Depends on the city/country, but the primary issue with lids is wildlife harm in my opinion so this does fix that issue.</p>"},{"id":"45cdd3029697c94a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by batch12 in \"Earth had hottest 3-months on record; unprecedented sea temps & extreme weather\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:03:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:03:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2850.440716826136,"y":2780.3615977627937,"wires":[["2cef94ce36463616"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458337\n<hr>\n<p>What works for you doesn't work for everyone.

A recollection of the late 19th century and early 20th, from 1930: <a href=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/01/get-horse-americas-skepticism-toward-first-automobiles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/01/get-horse-americ...</a><p>The whole story has salient parallels — parts suppliers were either reticent or inexperienced, fuel was cheap but not widely available, motors were slow, investors put money in before the market was there, founders lamenting the state of the modern laborer, early adopters stuck needing parts for vehicles orphaned by suddenly defunct manufacturers, and the guy getting all the money and attention is a wealthy idiot making self-crashing death traps who relies on free advice from his witless fans to avoid failure and profit. There's even a cameo from early EV manufacturer Electric Vehicle Company in 1899.<p>Tangentially, this is evocative:<p>> In the uncertainty of what the public would want, a great many strange contraptions were put together. Joseph Barsaleaux, a blacksmith of Sandy Hill, New York, built a motor horse. In his device, the horse moved on a single wheel about two feet in diameter, with the wheel attached to the shafts just as was a live horse. Reins attached to the mouth of the horse served as a steering gear, because the machinery was inside the horse and had to be regulated some way. The contraption weighed about 550 pounds, had a cruising speed of six miles an hour, and attracted some serious attention.<p>EV makers should probably stop trying to make mechanical horses — EV motors and cars that aren't competitive with ICE equivalents — and find a form factor that better suits both the market <i>and</i> the current state of the technology. Class 2 ebikes and small carts feel closer to that answer on short runs, but the long-haul equivalents are still missing.<p>Hell, Winton in this story is a bicycle manufacturer who makes his first horseless carriage from bicycles.</p>"},{"id":"1e6a603e85e63bb1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by throwaway858 in \"“Make” as a Static Site Generator (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:02:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:02:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6362.440716826136,"y":3260.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458332\n<hr>\n<p>The shake build system (a general-purpose build system similar-to/better-than make) has a \"prune\" feature for exactly this purpose:<p><a href=\"http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2015/04/cleaning-stale-files-with-shake.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2015/04/cleaning-stale-file...</a><p>But I think the best solution (that also works with make) is to have a \"make dist\" target that creates a final .tar.gz archive of the result.

In fact give tax breaks to people who build them even. Basically the idea that in a time when mortgage rates are 7% plus on a 1M house, and somehow you can find a rental for less than whatever that would cost is so unlikely that you have tons of people fighting for the rare case when that happens. But with an ADU it’s just a random additional space that could easily house a couple of people and charging a low rent and low utilities for that seems super likely.

The soft one, the pleasant one, is that there's much more of a sense of instilled community responsibility as children grow up. For instance in many schools in Japan there are literally no janitors - students clean their school as a part of learning self discipline, responsibility, and community obligation. Sticking a wad of gum under the desk, or pissing on a toilet seat, is quite different when you are the one cleaning it up.<p>The hard one, the less pleasant one, is that Japan has an extremely brutal criminal justice system, with allegations of torture regularly being made, and is extremely intolerant of people who disrupt society. If a person is being disruptive, police are going to take them away - and you will never see them again. I am not implying anything because I have no clue, or even idea, of what happens to them after that. And it's this way in most of every place in Asia that I have visited/lived.<p>In general I think the problem is that everywhere - 99% of people are awesome. But then you have this 1% that are either crazy, sociopathic, on drugs, or whatever else. And if you tolerate asocial abhorrent behavior from this extremely small minority, they will cause catastrophic disruption to society. If 1 in 100 patrons in a toilet destroys it, then it's going to be pretty much always destroyed.</p>"},{"id":"c5a981d482080b2c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by opengears in \"All-AMD Ryzen Notebooks for Linux Gamers: USB4, AMD GPU? and PCIe-Gen-4.0\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4504.440716826136,"y":2424.3615977627937,"wires":[["84f28ba87843217f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458392\n<hr>\n<p>I do not think that the vendor passes on $215 to microsoft, but 215 is what HP is charging their customers</p>"},{"id":"8efe6829ad801587","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by k310 in \"Total Advertising Denial\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8318.440716826135,"y":828.3615977627937,"wires":[["3a72eb175b2be128"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458390\n<hr>\n<p>The classic article is by George Monbiot at The Guardian 24 Oct 2011<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/24/advertising-poison-hooked\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/24/advert...</a><p>Advertising is a poison that demeans even love – and we're hooked on it<p>With AI everywhere, the trust level gets even lower<p><a href=\"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/psa-ebay-lets-chatgpt-make-up-item\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/psa-ebay-lets-chatgpt-make-up...</a><p>PSA: eBay lets ChatGPT make up item descriptions<p>And Chrome is playing its good-chrome/bad-chrome games.<p>That is to say, sites can ask Chrome directly what kinds of topics you're interested in – topics automatically selected by Chrome from your browsing history – so that ads personalized to your activities can be served.

I hope more people do.<p>Funnily I've seen a lot of programmers and math folks who express how truly, genuinely beautiful Beziers and the math behind them are. But I've never met an artist or graphic designer who didn't express some deep frustration at Bezier controls and how hard they are to work with.<p>There are even games[0] which make a mockery out of how hard Bezier controls are to use, where the game is purely using the controls.<p>Controls are just one side of the problem, in my view; the other side is that cubics are terrible for GPUs, they don't understand them - and I believe many of the best 2D graphics libraries today are not even fully GPU accelerated, e.g. Skia. There are folks working on compute shader-based approaches, where we try to shoe-horn this CPU-focused algorithm into GPUs and pray - but it still isn't really suitable.<p>The controls suck for artists, and the math sucks for GPUs. This is only true of cubics, if you restrict yourself to quadratics (although that brings other challenges), both the control issue goes away (you can just click+drag the curve!) and the performance issue goes away (quadratics are triangles, GPUs love them)<p>That's the summary of the talk[1] I gave at SYCL'22. In that talk, I didn't have time to present the downsides of my solution (which are real!) so if you watch it please keep that in mind - the talk is about the problem statement, not a solution. My overall point in there is a solid one: vector graphics as they exist today suck for artists and GPUs alike.<p>The only reason we stick with vector graphics in their current form is because of SVG & compatibility with existing tooling. But isn't it crazy? We have new bitmap image formats all the time, and so few vector graphics formats.<p>In Mach engine[2] we're continuing to explore this space, end-to-end, from author tooling -> format -> rendering. I'm not claiming we have a perfect solution, we don't, but we're at least thinking about this problem. Kudos to the authors of this article for thinking about this space as well.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://bezier.method.ac/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bezier.method.ac/</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTybQ-5MlrE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTybQ-5MlrE</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://machengine.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://machengine.org</a></p>"},{"id":"8d3de9da897bbdd5","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ParanoidShroom in \"I wired up my bike's GPS to order me pizza during a gravel race\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:12:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:12:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1980,"y":1532,"wires":[["bb45ade057f478bf"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458424\n<hr>\n<p>I don't see how one would do that.

The trustees—the same robber barons, or their representatives—would run the trust, deciding how to operate all these different, nominally competing railroads to maximize the return to the trustees (the railroads’ former owners).<p>> A trust was a way of merging all the dominant companies in a single industry (or even multiple related industries, like oil refineries, railroads, pipelines, and oil wells) into a single company, while maintaining the fiction that all of these companies were their own businesses.<p>> Any company that didn’t sell to the trust was quickly driven to its knees. For example, if you owned a freight company and wouldn’t sell out to the trust, all the railroads you depended on to carry your freight would charge you more than they’d charge your competitors for carrying the same freight—or they’d refuse to carry your freight at all.<p>> What’s more, any business that supplied a trust would quickly find itself stripped of its profit margins and either bankrupted and absorbed by the trust, or allowed to eke out bare survival. If you supplied coal to the railroad trust, all the railroads would refuse to buy your coal unless you knocked your prices down until you were making next to nothing—or losing money. Hell, if you got too frisky, they might refuse to carry your coal from the coal mine to the market, and then where’d you be?</p>"},{"id":"e7832618873b3b8b","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by pvg in \"Profound Beliefs\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6806.440716826136,"y":1436.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458459\n<hr>\n<p>Obviously, they have information in them, perhaps not information that's to your taste. \"Why are titles that are not to my taste allowed\" is at least a question that's relatively simple to figure out.</p>"},{"id":"105b33d774f92adb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by saaaaaam in \"Delightfully strange: Mystery 'golden egg' found on ocean floor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5286.440716826136,"y":3708.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458458\n<hr>\n<p>This is a little like examining a very small public park, poisoning a pigeon[^1] and worrying that you’ve wiped out an entire species.

Then you will understand why normal game devs are not welcome on elf/linux, thx to the very nice and video game caring glibc and gcc devs (irony):<p>First recipe:<p>You must not link in the glibc \"startup\" runtime objects, aka you must <i>not</i> have main(): your executable must be a pure ELF64 binary, only the \"_start\" ELF entry point and the ELF ABI (\"_start\" is basically a main() anyway). Careful: all glibc runtime services which require those \"startup\" runtime objects are gone (you need to be able to find out which ones... good luck browsing glibc code...). Because those glibc \"startup\" runtime objects often require the same version or above glibc runtime being around (it is very vicious, look at glibc 2.33->2.34 with the new version of the libc_startup symbol... delicious).<p>It means your build script on elf/linux must have fined grained compilation/linking (don't use the gcc compiler driver unless to discover static libgcc and static libstdc++ filesystem location... if you don't need to fork them).<p>All host system dependencies must be libdl (dlopen/dlsym/dlclose), yes even the libc, memcpy, <i>errno</i>, etc. Of course you will have to use the static libgcc and static libstdc++ (if c++ is used). Namely if your game binaries are pulling code paths from libgcc and libstdc++ which requires glibc services, you have to fork the libgcc and libstdc++ from the gcc you use in order to properly \"libdl-ized\" those code paths (readelf command will tell you that while you have a look at the undefined dynamic symbols... and their required version).<p>Then, you have the abomination of the ELF static flag: many glibc libraries have this flag, namely those libraries must be \"statically loaded\", namely have a ELF dynamic DT_NEED entry. You will find a ELF dynamic DT_NEED entry for libdl since you use (dlopen/dlsym/dlclose), and probably libpthread/libm(yes...!!!)/etc. Use the binutils readelf command to know if a library has the ELF static flag and must have such an entry (but you must still libdl it and its symbols to work around GNU symbol versioning issues!!). Some TLS code expect some TLS storage to be allocated and inited at executable startup, namely \"static\".<p>Of course, <i>all</i> distributed binaries must follow those guidelines... even from third party.<p>You want to expect normal game devs to be able to do that? <i>ABSURD</i><p>2nd recipe:<p>you get your hands on the most recent gcc, and the oldest glibc you want to support (~10years, more?). Compile such glibc, then this gcc to use <i>only</i> this very glibc (good luck configuring that cleanly). You can use main() and directly glibc services here, but still, you must libdl everything from the video game core libs (you need the headers only).\nExpecting that to go smoothly is just unreasonable, it will probably be a nightmare.\nAll your distributed binaries must be built using this gcc and glibc.<p>Expecting normal game devs to do that? <i>GROTESQUE</i><p>The video game core libs on elf/linux are:\nwayland(static code in binaries)/libxkbcommon fallback-to-> x11/libxkbcommon-x11 (don't use libX11, only xcb libs).\nvulkan fallback-to-> GL fallback-to->CPU, be very conservative with shaders, <i>VERY</i>.\nlibasound: alsa-lib, the software mixer is hidden behind the API, as it could be pulseaudio1/pulseaudio2(pipewire/wireplumber)/dmix/dsnoop/jack/whatever, have a ffmpeg resampling library ready if your audio formats are weird, or the user microphone audio format is weird. The trick: make user configurable the \"speaker configuration\" (5.1/7.1/headphones/stereo/etc), but with a automatic fallback to stereo if unable to open the device (all software mixers should support stereo mixing).<p>joypad: linux /dev/input/eventXX files, check write access if you want to configure the rumbles. You can implement dynamic detection with linux inotify there (usually overkill though).</p>"},{"id":"268029e78e0f2ab9","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Ozempic, Wegovy

related UI since about 2000, mostly working for or at large consumer brands (and now thinking of retiring).<p>I'd definitely agree with the idea that change for change's sake is responsible for a lot of usability problems.<p>But a bigger problem is the near extinction of any professional discussion or capable analysis of design by the people who are doing it.<p>Most designers I work with don't have the vocabulary or knowledge about what makes something \"usable\" in the wider sense, let alone the ability to actually solve subtle interaction design or information display problems. With no knowledge or interest in basic heuristics, they literally don't know where to start. So they just live in Figma playing with colours, shapes and effects, pausing only to show some variations of the same UI for \"user testing\". It's become a wilfully ignorant, \"non-technical\" cult of innovation that's completely lost sight of its original purpose.<p>To say I'm ashamed of my profession is no exaggeration.

Knuth seems to think pretty highly of this decision:<p><i>“The quadratic has  the great advantage that  there's a real cheap way to render them. You  can make hardware to  draw a quadratic spline lickety-split. It's all Greek mathematics, the conic sections. You can describe a quadratic spline by a quadratic equation (x, y) so that the value of f(x, y) is positive on one side of the  curve and negative on the other side. And then you can just follow along pixel by pixel, and when x changes by one and y changes by  one, you can  see which way to move to draw the curve   in the optimal   way. And the mathematics  is really simple for a quadratic. The corresponding thing  for a cubic is six times as complicated, and it has  extra very strange effects in it\nbecause cubic curves can have cusps in  them that are hidden. They can have places  where  the function will  be  plus on both   sides of the cubic, instead of plus on one side and minus on the other.</i><p><i>“The   algorithm that's like  the quadratic  one,  but for cubics, turns   out that you    can be in  something   that looks like  a very innocuous   curve,   but  mathematically you're   passing   a singular\npoint. That's sort of  like a dividing by zero  even though it doesn't look like there's any reason  to do so. The   bottom line is that  the\nquadratic   curves that TrueType  uses   allow extremely fast hardware\nimplementations, in parallel.”</i><p><a href=\"https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2000-01/msg00052.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2000-01...</a></p>"},{"id":"42a14c0ddaf40f79","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jandrese in \"How does Linux NAT a ping?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:21:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:21:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3590,"y":360,"wires":[["21500f84a220962"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458526\n<hr>\n<p>With IPv6 you would do stateless autoconfigurarion, so there would be no manually setting of your addresses.

There's no way Khrushchev or the government as a whole wanted open war with the USSR, but maybe some did, and maybe some thought that they could prod Oswald into an assassination without getting caught.
