How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4886.440716826136,"y":820.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6022.440716826136,"y":2220.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4886.440716826136,"y":2564.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

But this has no bearing on the question of whether it's rational to assign higher prices to naturally produced diamonds. There are many other things that are unethically produced, that people pay high prices for, and where those prices are viewed as sensible (eg. oil, smart phones, opioids).<p>As for your second point, there is a large marketing component for most things that are bought and sold, including art and memorabilia. You say that for diamonds, the value is fabricated. But I believe the fabrication of value creates real consequences. It's not trivial to coordinate the action and common knowledge of an entire population. If you do it right, it creates a new Nash equilibrium. If someone then gifts you a natural diamond, it is irrational to sell it at the synthetic price. Your buyer might even be a diamond dealer who also believes the natural-synthetic thing is a marketing scam. The whole population can even know the whole situation is fabricated.

I think what isn't clear is which way the causal relationship goes, and I don't think there is any reason why it has to be just one way. Our minds affect our bodies, and vice-versa, but it can be very complex.<p>One thing that I've figured out in relation to all of this though, is that if I'm ever feeling emotionally bad, focusing on doing what's best for my body always helps. For example, going through a breakup or divorce is emotionally painful and I don't think most people would blame their body for that pain (I wouldn't), but any time I've gone through a heartbreak, I've found that the best remedy is to hit the gym, stay active, and eat healthy.
