It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5498.440716826136,"y":732.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3894.440716826136,"y":2252.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3386.440716826136,"y":2692.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

According to this article, caps and lids made out of plastic may be placed on the market only if the caps and lids remain attached to the containers during the products’ intended use stage. Tethered caps will become mandatory in the EU in July 2024.<p>Why is this a thing? Because plastic lids are made of a harder plastic that doesn't degrade as quickly and is much less recycled than the bottles themselves. How prevalent is this? In the last 30 years 20 million bottle caps have been found on beaches alone in Europe during clean-up work. They are in the top 5 ocean trash items that ultimately kill wildlife. This is only a small snapshot of the ultimate number of bottle caps not recycled aside their bottles.<p>To fix this, the EU suggest tethering the lid to the bottle so they're less easily lost and more likely to be recycled properly. 20 companies are responsible for the majority of throwaway plastics in the world, so this change is required in only a few places but could have a large net-benefit. Ultimately this is something that can only come from top-down optimization - why? Because it increases costs for each bottle.<p>> This new bottle cap design requirement must have created a new economy for producing these bottle caps for all of the containers, someone profited.<p>Companies lost money from this and tried to lobby to avoid it by trying ideas first, and then tethering if those failed.<p>> There are massive problems around waste that no one there dares to approach, so they make these weird directives that just smell of corruption and incompetence.<p>Why can't we tackle the small and the large?<p>> Many cities, to avoid fines, provide separate containers, but in the end just throw everything on the same pile.<p>Depends on the city/country, but the primary issue with lids is wildlife harm in my opinion so this does fix that issue.</p>"},{"id":"45cdd3029697c94a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by batch12 in \"Earth had hottest 3-months on record; unprecedented sea temps & extreme weather\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:03:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:03:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2850.440716826136,"y":2220.3615977627937,"wires":[["2cef94ce36463616"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458337\n<hr>\n<p>What works for you doesn't work for everyone.

There's even a cameo from early EV manufacturer Electric Vehicle Company in 1899.<p>Tangentially, this is evocative:<p>> In the uncertainty of what the public would want, a great many strange contraptions were put together. Joseph Barsaleaux, a blacksmith of Sandy Hill, New York, built a motor horse. In his device, the horse moved on a single wheel about two feet in diameter, with the wheel attached to the shafts just as was a live horse. Reins attached to the mouth of the horse served as a steering gear, because the machinery was inside the horse and had to be regulated some way. The contraption weighed about 550 pounds, had a cruising speed of six miles an hour, and attracted some serious attention.<p>EV makers should probably stop trying to make mechanical horses — EV motors and cars that aren't competitive with ICE equivalents — and find a form factor that better suits both the market <i>and</i> the current state of the technology. Class 2 ebikes and small carts feel closer to that answer on short runs, but the long-haul equivalents are still missing.<p>Hell, Winton in this story is a bicycle manufacturer who makes his first horseless carriage from bicycles.</p>"},{"id":"1e6a603e85e63bb1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by throwaway858 in \"“Make” as a Static Site Generator (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:02:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:02:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5698.440716826136,"y":3420.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458332\n<hr>\n<p>The shake build system (a general-purpose build system similar-to/better-than make) has a \"prune\" feature for exactly this purpose:<p><a href=\"http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2015/04/cleaning-stale-files-with-shake.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2015/04/cleaning-stale-file...</a><p>But I think the best solution (that also works with make) is to have a \"make dist\" target that creates a final .tar.gz archive of the result.

Basically the idea that in a time when mortgage rates are 7% plus on a 1M house, and somehow you can find a rental for less than whatever that would cost is so unlikely that you have tons of people fighting for the rare case when that happens. But with an ADU it’s just a random additional space that could easily house a couple of people and charging a low rent and low utilities for that seems super likely.

The soft one, the pleasant one, is that there's much more of a sense of instilled community responsibility as children grow up. For instance in many schools in Japan there are literally no janitors - students clean their school as a part of learning self discipline, responsibility, and community obligation. Sticking a wad of gum under the desk, or pissing on a toilet seat, is quite different when you are the one cleaning it up.<p>The hard one, the less pleasant one, is that Japan has an extremely brutal criminal justice system, with allegations of torture regularly being made, and is extremely intolerant of people who disrupt society. If a person is being disruptive, police are going to take them away - and you will never see them again. I am not implying anything because I have no clue, or even idea, of what happens to them after that. And it's this way in most of every place in Asia that I have visited/lived.<p>In general I think the problem is that everywhere - 99% of people are awesome. But then you have this 1% that are either crazy, sociopathic, on drugs, or whatever else. And if you tolerate asocial abhorrent behavior from this extremely small minority, they will cause catastrophic disruption to society. If 1 in 100 patrons in a toilet destroys it, then it's going to be pretty much always destroyed.</p>"},{"id":"c5a981d482080b2c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by opengears in \"All-AMD Ryzen Notebooks for Linux Gamers: USB4, AMD GPU? and PCIe-Gen-4.0\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4504.440716826136,"y":2344.3615977627937,"wires":[["84f28ba87843217f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458392\n<hr>\n<p>I do not think that the vendor passes on $215 to microsoft, but 215 is what HP is charging their customers</p>"},{"id":"8efe6829ad801587","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by k310 in \"Total Advertising Denial\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:07:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8318.440716826135,"y":828.3615977627937,"wires":[["3a72eb175b2be128"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458390\n<hr>\n<p>The classic article is by George Monbiot at The Guardian 24 Oct 2011<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/24/advertising-poison-hooked\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/24/advert...</a><p>Advertising is a poison that demeans even love – and we're hooked on it<p>With AI everywhere, the trust level gets even lower<p><a href=\"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/psa-ebay-lets-chatgpt-make-up-item\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/psa-ebay-lets-chatgpt-make-up...</a><p>PSA: eBay lets ChatGPT make up item descriptions<p>And Chrome is playing its good-chrome/bad-chrome games.<p>That is to say, sites can ask Chrome directly what kinds of topics you're interested in – topics automatically selected by Chrome from your browsing history – so that ads personalized to your activities can be served.

I will now set up keepalived as mentioned in the other reply so the HAProxies will also be fully HA. Proxmox also works well with zfs and backups.\nI set up the proxmox nodes manually and did the rest with terraform + ansible.

I hope more people do.<p>Funnily I've seen a lot of programmers and math folks who express how truly, genuinely beautiful Beziers and the math behind them are. But I've never met an artist or graphic designer who didn't express some deep frustration at Bezier controls and how hard they are to work with.<p>There are even games[0] which make a mockery out of how hard Bezier controls are to use, where the game is purely using the controls.<p>Controls are just one side of the problem, in my view; the other side is that cubics are terrible for GPUs, they don't understand them - and I believe many of the best 2D graphics libraries today are not even fully GPU accelerated, e.g. Skia. There are folks working on compute shader-based approaches, where we try to shoe-horn this CPU-focused algorithm into GPUs and pray - but it still isn't really suitable.<p>The controls suck for artists, and the math sucks for GPUs. This is only true of cubics, if you restrict yourself to quadratics (although that brings other challenges), both the control issue goes away (you can just click+drag the curve!) and the performance issue goes away (quadratics are triangles, GPUs love them)<p>That's the summary of the talk[1] I gave at SYCL'22. In that talk, I didn't have time to present the downsides of my solution (which are real!) so if you watch it please keep that in mind - the talk is about the problem statement, not a solution. My overall point in there is a solid one: vector graphics as they exist today suck for artists and GPUs alike.<p>The only reason we stick with vector graphics in their current form is because of SVG & compatibility with existing tooling. But isn't it crazy? We have new bitmap image formats all the time, and so few vector graphics formats.<p>In Mach engine[2] we're continuing to explore this space, end-to-end, from author tooling -> format -> rendering. I'm not claiming we have a perfect solution, we don't, but we're at least thinking about this problem. Kudos to the authors of this article for thinking about this space as well.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://bezier.method.ac/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bezier.method.ac/</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTybQ-5MlrE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTybQ-5MlrE</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://machengine.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://machengine.org</a></p>"},{"id":"8d3de9da897bbdd5","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ParanoidShroom in \"I wired up my bike's GPS to order me pizza during a gravel race\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:12:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:12:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1980,"y":1372,"wires":[["bb45ade057f478bf"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458424\n<hr>\n<p>I don't see how one would do that.

The trustees—the same robber barons, or their representatives—would run the trust, deciding how to operate all these different, nominally competing railroads to maximize the return to the trustees (the railroads’ former owners).<p>> A trust was a way of merging all the dominant companies in a single industry (or even multiple related industries, like oil refineries, railroads, pipelines, and oil wells) into a single company, while maintaining the fiction that all of these companies were their own businesses.<p>> Any company that didn’t sell to the trust was quickly driven to its knees. For example, if you owned a freight company and wouldn’t sell out to the trust, all the railroads you depended on to carry your freight would charge you more than they’d charge your competitors for carrying the same freight—or they’d refuse to carry your freight at all.<p>> What’s more, any business that supplied a trust would quickly find itself stripped of its profit margins and either bankrupted and absorbed by the trust, or allowed to eke out bare survival. If you supplied coal to the railroad trust, all the railroads would refuse to buy your coal unless you knocked your prices down until you were making next to nothing—or losing money. Hell, if you got too frisky, they might refuse to carry your coal from the coal mine to the market, and then where’d you be?</p>"},{"id":"e7832618873b3b8b","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by pvg in \"Profound Beliefs\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4598.440716826136,"y":1436.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458459\n<hr>\n<p>Obviously, they have information in them, perhaps not information that's to your taste. \"Why are titles that are not to my taste allowed\" is at least a question that's relatively simple to figure out.</p>"},{"id":"105b33d774f92adb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by saaaaaam in \"Delightfully strange: Mystery 'golden egg' found on ocean floor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:15:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2758.440716826136,"y":3868.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458458\n<hr>\n<p>This is a little like examining a very small public park, poisoning a pigeon[^1] and worrying that you’ve wiped out an entire species.

Then you will understand why normal game devs are not welcome on elf/linux, thx to the very nice and video game caring glibc and gcc devs (irony):<p>First recipe:<p>You must not link in the glibc \"startup\" runtime objects, aka you must <i>not</i> have main(): your executable must be a pure ELF64 binary, only the \"_start\" ELF entry point and the ELF ABI (\"_start\" is basically a main() anyway). Careful: all glibc runtime services which require those \"startup\" runtime objects are gone (you need to be able to find out which ones... good luck browsing glibc code...). Because those glibc \"startup\" runtime objects often require the same version or above glibc runtime being around (it is very vicious, look at glibc 2.33->2.34 with the new version of the libc_startup symbol... delicious).<p>It means your build script on elf/linux must have fined grained compilation/linking (don't use the gcc compiler driver unless to discover static libgcc and static libstdc++ filesystem location... if you don't need to fork them).<p>All host system dependencies must be libdl (dlopen/dlsym/dlclose), yes even the libc, memcpy, <i>errno</i>, etc. Of course you will have to use the static libgcc and static libstdc++ (if c++ is used). Namely if your game binaries are pulling code paths from libgcc and libstdc++ which requires glibc services, you have to fork the libgcc and libstdc++ from the gcc you use in order to properly \"libdl-ized\" those code paths (readelf command will tell you that while you have a look at the undefined dynamic symbols... and their required version).<p>Then, you have the abomination of the ELF static flag: many glibc libraries have this flag, namely those libraries must be \"statically loaded\", namely have a ELF dynamic DT_NEED entry. You will find a ELF dynamic DT_NEED entry for libdl since you use (dlopen/dlsym/dlclose), and probably libpthread/libm(yes...!!!)/etc. Use the binutils readelf command to know if a library has the ELF static flag and must have such an entry (but you must still libdl it and its symbols to work around GNU symbol versioning issues!!). Some TLS code expect some TLS storage to be allocated and inited at executable startup, namely \"static\".<p>Of course, <i>all</i> distributed binaries must follow those guidelines... even from third party.<p>You want to expect normal game devs to be able to do that? <i>ABSURD</i><p>2nd recipe:<p>you get your hands on the most recent gcc, and the oldest glibc you want to support (~10years, more?). Compile such glibc, then this gcc to use <i>only</i> this very glibc (good luck configuring that cleanly). You can use main() and directly glibc services here, but still, you must libdl everything from the video game core libs (you need the headers only).\nExpecting that to go smoothly is just unreasonable, it will probably be a nightmare.\nAll your distributed binaries must be built using this gcc and glibc.<p>Expecting normal game devs to do that? <i>GROTESQUE</i><p>The video game core libs on elf/linux are:\nwayland(static code in binaries)/libxkbcommon fallback-to-> x11/libxkbcommon-x11 (don't use libX11, only xcb libs).\nvulkan fallback-to-> GL fallback-to->CPU, be very conservative with shaders, <i>VERY</i>.\nlibasound: alsa-lib, the software mixer is hidden behind the API, as it could be pulseaudio1/pulseaudio2(pipewire/wireplumber)/dmix/dsnoop/jack/whatever, have a ffmpeg resampling library ready if your audio formats are weird, or the user microphone audio format is weird. The trick: make user configurable the \"speaker configuration\" (5.1/7.1/headphones/stereo/etc), but with a automatic fallback to stereo if unable to open the device (all software mixers should support stereo mixing).<p>joypad: linux /dev/input/eventXX files, check write access if you want to configure the rumbles. You can implement dynamic detection with linux inotify there (usually overkill though).</p>"},{"id":"268029e78e0f2ab9","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Ozempic, Wegovy

of usability problems.<p>But a bigger problem is the near extinction of any professional discussion or capable analysis of design by the people who are doing it.<p>Most designers I work with don't have the vocabulary or knowledge about what makes something \"usable\" in the wider sense, let alone the ability to actually solve subtle interaction design or information display problems. With no knowledge or interest in basic heuristics, they literally don't know where to start. So they just live in Figma playing with colours, shapes and effects, pausing only to show some variations of the same UI for \"user testing\". It's become a wilfully ignorant, \"non-technical\" cult of innovation that's completely lost sight of its original purpose.<p>To say I'm ashamed of my profession is no exaggeration.

Knuth seems to think pretty highly of this decision:<p><i>“The quadratic has  the great advantage that  there's a real cheap way to render them. You  can make hardware to  draw a quadratic spline lickety-split. It's all Greek mathematics, the conic sections. You can describe a quadratic spline by a quadratic equation (x, y) so that the value of f(x, y) is positive on one side of the  curve and negative on the other side. And then you can just follow along pixel by pixel, and when x changes by one and y changes by  one, you can  see which way to move to draw the curve   in the optimal   way. And the mathematics  is really simple for a quadratic. The corresponding thing  for a cubic is six times as complicated, and it has  extra very strange effects in it\nbecause cubic curves can have cusps in  them that are hidden. They can have places  where  the function will  be  plus on both   sides of the cubic, instead of plus on one side and minus on the other.</i><p><i>“The   algorithm that's like  the quadratic  one,  but for cubics, turns   out that you    can be in  something   that looks like  a very innocuous   curve,   but  mathematically you're   passing   a singular\npoint. That's sort of  like a dividing by zero  even though it doesn't look like there's any reason  to do so. The   bottom line is that  the\nquadratic   curves that TrueType  uses   allow extremely fast hardware\nimplementations, in parallel.”</i><p><a href=\"https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2000-01/msg00052.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2000-01...</a></p>"},{"id":"42a14c0ddaf40f79","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jandrese in \"How does Linux NAT a ping?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:21:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:21:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3590,"y":240,"wires":[["21500f84a220962"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458526\n<hr>\n<p>With IPv6 you would do stateless autoconfigurarion, so there would be no manually setting of your addresses.

When maximum torque is required, especially at low speeds, the magnetic field strength (B) should be maximum – so that inverter and motor currents are maintained at their lowest possible values. This minimizes the I² R (current² resistance) losses and thereby optimizes efficiency. Likewise, when torque levels are low, the B field should be reduced such that eddy and hysteresis losses due to B are also reduced. Ideally, B should be adjusted such that the sum of the eddy, hysteresis, and I² losses is minimized. Unfortunately, there is no easy way of changing B with permanent magnets.\n</code></pre>\nEssentially, this new tech combines the best of Permanent Magnet Brushless DC and Induction motors. It allows you to change the magnetic field B without contact.<p>The losses in the shaft coils are low when B is low so the gains in efficiency for an \"eco mode\" would be excellent as you modulate B for low torque and you would still retain the ability to crank up the power in a \"sport mode\" at the cost of efficiency.<p>[1]<a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-motors\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-mot...</a></p>"},{"id":"66010987e5160685","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by askonomm in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4462.440716826136,"y":3252.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458833\n<hr>\n<p>In Estonian motherboard is emaplaat.</p>"},{"id":"9f308a278c10dd36","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by weinzierl in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5360.440716826136,"y":1968.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458832\n<hr>\n<p>I always had a strong interest in security and that's the direction I developed even when still in automotive.

Senior engineers should be able to talk to design about a redesign necessary because iOS just isn't capable of this it turns out or the cool effect you saw is only available on a version we don't use and can't update to right because complex reason.<p>If you're just taking your requirements and working without having to negotiate with another person, you're probably not doing senior work.<p>Some of it I the site I don't think is senior work really unless you're a tiny shop, but they're not weird since these are all skills a for senior adjacent roles that any senior might be called on to take randomly. It's not uncommon in many shops for leads to be a spontaneous and temporary role for some project that disappears on major release.</p>"},{"id":"71a978170b59102e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by beebmam in \"Why SaaS prices are still going up when companies are spending less\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3095.2784683070035,"y":1336.9635509585378,"wires":[["158f5c87eddcad5c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459024\n<hr>\n<p>Terms like SaaS, IaaS, PaaS are pretty fluid outside of specific contexts.</p>"},{"id":"762c730c248c38b3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by eep_social in \"“Make” as a Static Site Generator (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3894.440716826136,"y":3308.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459023\n<hr>\n<p>I agree with everything you wrote — what I was trying to communicate is that there’s no shame in not feeling the urge to share as it happens to be that the vast majority of us, like the gp post, don’t but that’s not easy to see or quantify.<p>Aside, I almost wrote “silent majority” but that seemed like it was veering towards politics so I went with vocal minority; I suspect there is a better term out there but I didn’t find it quickly.</p>"},{"id":"306cc08c64b8baf7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by slt2021 in \"How does Linux NAT a ping?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3590,"y":440,"wires":[["21500f84a220962"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459022\n<hr>\n<p>NAT stands for Network Address Translation, which means a NAT device maintains a translation table of internal IPs to external, so that it can return response packets coming from Internet to a proper destination on the internal network.<p>By definition NAT will maintain state which is translation table.

It was the early 10s, and that's when the lan part of the lan party was truely dead. Everyone stopped playing TF2, and CS, and everyone moved to League of Legends.

The internet, especially text heavy fora such as HN, Reddit, 4Chan, etc. are best used as a sounding board for thoughts and ideas you may have, but do not believe or have not yet determined the validity of.  I love to take a hyperbolic stance of something i kind of think, or just an iconoclastic/heterodox stance and see how the discussion develops.
