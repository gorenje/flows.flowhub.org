the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8806.440716826135,"y":348.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7606.440716826136,"y":2348.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5334.440716826136,"y":3156.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

stalls out, I have to play hot potato over their incredibly long list of available exit nodes just to try and find one that will work for another 5-10 minutes before I lose connection again.<p>Maybe

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

And back then, such a low-RAM card was only doing 2D acceleration at most, with a little offscreen buffer for fonts and sprites that would be blitted into the active framebuffer or composed at the DAC by the card itself (like the cursor).<p>Just for your example, 1024x768 would require a minimum of 3 MB just for a single buffer of pixels if stored with today's typical 4-byte RGBA and updated in immediate mode. A double-buffering technique would take twice as much. Most often, we were using either 8-bit pseudo-color mode or maybe 2-byte 15-bit true color with only 5 bits per RGB component and no transparency. A 2MB card might support 1024x768 in 15-bit mode or 1280x1024 in 8-bit mode.<p>I distinctly remember on my first serious Linux machine when I downloaded a single large JPEG image from an academic site and displayed it with the \"xv\" command which was the go-to image viewer at the time. It required virtual memory swapping because the image buffer to store the decoded image would be larger than my entire 20MB of system RAM. This was an unusual image, interesting to me mostly for this fact.

Based on his presentation of the evidence I think it was just Lee Harvey Oswald taking an attack of opportunity. \nIt seems likely he was working at the building by happenstance, heard/read that the motercade would pass by, and hasily planned the assassination in secret. \nHe had a motive that doesn't require any conspiracy as he was self admittedly a marxist and was described as \"unstable\". \nTo me, his murder of a police officer immediately following the assassination is indicative of mental instability rather than a carefully planned conspiracy.\nI also consider the reports of multiple gunshots unreliable; I remember being nearby Parliment in Ottawa during the 2014 shootings at Parliment Hill. There was incredible confusion when it started, and rumours and miscommunications travelled at lightning speed since everyone feared for their lives. At first there were reports of multiple gunman in several different locations near the actual shooting because of echoes off of nearby buildings and return fire from police. Really it was a lone gunman, and despite those inital reports I'm not aware of any conspiracies about the whole event. \nI think the true conspiracy, if any, was that any of the people involved who failed in their role to prevent the assassination of the president by a lone unstable man, or to conduct a flawless investigation following it, were incentivized to bend evidence and testimoney in their favour (whether unconsciously or intentionally). I don't think this was done out of malice, rather, who would want to admit to any actions that could conceivably invite criticism? In the article itself he provides several (perhaps reasonable) reasons for why he moved the bullet at all, probably to defend against criticism that leaving all evidence in place (seems to me) would have been the best course of action.\nAs for the article itself, human memory is notoriously unreliable (even shortly after shocking events like this), so even if he beleives he is telling the truth, and isn't interested in the profit motive, I don't think it's compelling enough evidence to believe in a conspiracy beyond human fallacy.</p>"},{"id":"1c514838179d1227","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by nomel in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:19:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:19:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5350.440716826136,"y":1828.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460176\n<hr>\n<p>> And all Zf transmissions had a major design fault up until the current 8 Speed<p>Any reference or hint?

Honestly, I like Django more for its less implicit approach, ORM with automatically generated migrations for common cases, and great ecosystem (check out Django REST Framework, Django Filter, Django Reactor, and Django Unicorn, to name a few) If you already like Django and have learned its ins and outs, time spent learning Rails would be better spent actually building something with Django. Also, a lot of big, successful companies have been built with Django, among them Pinterest and Instagram.<p>With that said, if you want to try something new and need something better suited for scalable, real-time applications, the combination of Elixir & Phoenix is similar to Rails but also less implicit, and it runs on a battled-tested runtime with fault-tolerance and low latency built in.<p>Finally, if you’re building a CRUD-ish SAAS app that needs a constant server connection, check out Phoenix LiveView for a very robust and dev-friendly solution. For the type of apps it was meant for, it’s really the technology to beat (I use it for my day job)!</p>"},{"id":"440e29443a06b406","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by hinkley in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:33:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:33:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3112.440716826136,"y":1180.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460296\n<hr>\n<p>This is why we can't have nice things.</p>"},{"id":"d40af31b633a898a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by emodendroket in \"Why Is the Ocean Salty?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:33:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:33:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2783,"y":3430,"wires":[["3397c5f36dd0cf45"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460295\n<hr>\n<p>It is an argument against the idea that it’s an insane idea from socialists gone mad since conservative regimes found it equally useful.</p>"},{"id":"179b9555d91fa4a9","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by colordrops in \"The U.S. housing market vs. the Canadian housing market\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:33:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:33:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5982.440716826136,"y":3588.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460294\n<hr>\n<p>Where are you?

They go on to say that pretty much any conspiracy theory relies on cherry-picking certain details as irrefutable while ignoring others and this is esentially an arbitrary decision based on whatever narrative someone is pushing.<p>Additionally, the details supposedly changed never make sense for a conspiracy that is supposedly powerful enough to arrange all this.<p>Lastly, people often see things through a modern lens. Presidential security is a big one. JFK used to stop his motorcade and go into the crowd. Anyone with a handgun could've ended him. These people weren't all frisked and vetted. It was a different time. JFK's assassination is probably a big part of why presidential security changed. So the idea that you needed to have or be a sniper (or a team of snipers) is a silly one and based on modern assumptions.<p>Myths in this area persist too despite them being debunked. One that springs to mind is that you couldn't fire Oswald's rifle fast enough. CBS and the FBI tested and debunked this in the 1960s [2].<p>When this happens you'll often find the conspiracy theory moves the goalposts from it being \"impossible\" to \"very hard\". I'm sure it was hard but Oswald was also irrefutably a Marine-trained shooter.<p>Personally my theory is that any mystery surrounding JFK is much like that of 9-11: intelligence agencies caught with their pants down, not wanting to upset allies and/or not wanting to expose intelligence assets.<p>The last point I'll make is a study was recently done on the link between narcissism and conspiracy theories [3]. Now this has a lot of relevance to why who gets sucked into QAnon and their political leanings. But it's relevant beyond that.<p>A lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea that random things happen. They'd rather believe it's all part of a plan. It's almost preferable if it's a nefarious force as some people love to LARP as being oppressed or even just being brave warriors standing up for what's righteous. But this shares a lot of the psychology with those for a predilection for religion. And narcissim is the definition of main character syndrome.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u7euN1HTuU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u7euN1HTuU</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_rifle#CBS_firing_test_in_1967\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_...</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35816915/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35816915/</a></p>"},{"id":"ae43cb00222424f8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by distract8901 in \"Heat pumps show how hard decarbonisation will be\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:44:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:44:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8754.440716826135,"y":3532.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460380\n<hr>\n<p>Inverter refers to the power control system.<p>Your typical AC unit has a single solenoid that physically makes or breaks the connection across your 240v line. That's the big clunk you hear when the compressor kicks on. This type of control is either all the way on or all the way off.<p>An inverter topology uses a bunch of electronics to convert your incoming 240v to a lower voltage or even frequency. This gives the electronics very fine control over how the motor works. You can start up slow, or run the motor at 50% or anything you want.<p>This doesn't really have anything to do with whether the motor itself is brushless. All brushless motors require advanced drive electronics. This usually ends up being pretty similar to an inverter topology, but not necessarily. A brushed motor doesn't care, you can just jam some electricity in and get motion out.<p>What you think of when you say \"brushless motor\" is categorically -not- the kind of motor in an AC unit. AC compressors use larger induction motors which may not have brushes, but they are not 'brushless motors'<p>A brushless motor specifically refers to a particular type of <i>DC</i> motor which uses phased, stationary coils to move a rotor with a ring of magnets. An AC induction motor may use either an iron core in the rotor, or a coil of wire that produces a magnetic field for the stator windings to push against.</p>"},{"id":"30260bbd0d8ddc9d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by hirundo in \"Walter Isaacson: Elon Musk set Tesla on a new course for self-driving\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:44:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:44:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3090.440716826136,"y":3324.3615977627937,"wires":[["c345a80ae1c705e1"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460379\n<hr>\n<p>It says that this does for driving what Stable Diffusion does for images, ChatGPT for chat, AlphaZero for chess.

That's the whole point of doing an overall excess mortality analysis: it means you don't have to know the specific cause of each individual death or how temperature affected it. You can just compare expected deaths at \"normal\" temperature to actual deaths at the actual temperature (I am oversimplifying here, the actual methodology is more complex than that, but that's the basic idea).<p>This methodology was not made up for this specific case. Overall excess mortality analysis is used in all kinds of contexts. For example, it is used to estimate the overall impact of COVID, for much the same reasons--because it takes into account indirect effects of COVID that would otherwise be very hard to measure. The methodology is not perfect (no methodology is), but it is the best we have for this kind of analysis.</p>"},{"id":"e1e5e8278f318619","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Rushed exodus frm rain soaked BurningMan could have adverse environmental

It's just a process optimized to minimize false positives, so, only the median will get in, really good ones will be rejected and only maybe a very small fraction of the ones who make it through will be \"The real deal\".</p>"},{"id":"12c881da161c5f8c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by codeulike in \"Effectiveness of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:59:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 21:59:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6062.440716826136,"y":3756.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460520\n<hr>\n<p>I was really surprised to read of the positive results.

Or you can do mock interviews with others, but I am not a fan of these personally.<p>In my experience, reading, and then trying to come up with designs on your own for well-known products will make you ace these interviews after a few months.<p>Also, during the interview there is no nearly enough time to verify that you have done in the past all the things you will mention. So, if you understand what you are saying, and your design makes sense, you will pass the interview, even if you haven't practiced these things in your day job.</p>"},{"id":"8f5dd6fc191d340d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by yieldcrv in \"How to pass the interview for software engineering roles in Big Tech\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:04:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:04:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2653,"y":3190,"wires":[["b2b159db30507ce"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460557\n<hr>\n<p>I've tried that, people don't see me as a manager, for them.<p>Its a different \"culture fit\" metric than IC.

I simply don't understand who would want to buy any of the currently available players because they'll are so terrible to <i>use</i>.  The good ones were killed off by a combination of streaming services and Android devices. There are no more light-weight, simple players with high capacity, physical buttons and good battery life. You know, the kind of thing you could put into your pocket take on your run without bruising yourself. The kind of thing that has a legible screen, sane menu layout, that can read tags from your files and let you simply drag playlists into them. I know that there are people who want these things, but manufacturers are instead releasing gigantic bricks with protruding knobs and weird edges, huge battery-draining touch screens, running some dreadful Android hack of an OS. Reviews rarely discuss the most important aspects of a <i>portable</i> music device, and instead gush like wine critics about the ... I don't know, <i>smell</i>(?) or <i>taste</i>(?) of the music. I'm only half joking. The more prestigious the reviewer the more bollocks they write, and half the time I can't even find mention of the weight or size. Or when they do, they're plain wrong (eg: \"The Shanling Q1 is a light weight portable device\"... No it's f*cking not, it's an awful brick with a shitty OS, bad battery life, overly sensitive buttons.

In particular, it's not the best approximation to a circular arc, which by most reasonable definitions is the smoothest possible curve. I did the math[1] and found that there's a parabola around each endpoint that <i>does</i> result in an accurate arc approximation, and in fact may be easier to apply as it doesn't move around as the length of the curve changes. Rather, each of the parabolas can be applied independently.<p>Evidence in favor of this is O(n^5) accuracy scaling to approximate Euler spirals (which are also a good candidate for \"smoothest possible curve\" depending on the way you define that). I suspect, but haven't yet demonstrated, that there's some variational sense in which this choice is optimum, or at least to a first order approximation.<p>You can think of cubic Béziers as forming a four-dimensional parameter space (the parameters can be accounted as the lengths and angles of the control handles; in this scheme, the positions of the endpoints are not counted). By applying a rule such as 1/3 arc length, or falling on a parabola, that reduces it to a two-dimensional space (same dimensionality as quadratic Beziers, Euler spirals, and sections of rectangular elastica). I think two dimensions is too few, as it doesn't give you the ability to easily form superellipse shapes, a particular strength of cubic Béziers and quite handy for font design, as superellipse is extremely useful. I think there may be some value in exploring a three-dimensional parameter space (which, among other things, is the count for general elastica) and have some ideas.<p>As for (2), the problem is that for s-shaped curves, cubic Béziers tend to put curvature maxima <i>near</i> but not exactly <i>on</i> endpoints. Since the curvature maximum is visually salient, you do better subdividing your curves so you can place them at joins. Other curve families, notably those based on elastica and Euler spirals, don't have this problem.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2021/02/19/parallel-curves.html#euler-spirals-to-cubic-b%C3%A9ziers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2021/02/19/parallel-curve...</a></p>"},{"id":"a32f910986456090","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by lambrospetrou in \"How to pass the interview for software engineering roles in Big Tech\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:24:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 22:24:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2653,"y":3790,"wires":[["b2b159db30507ce"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460743\n<hr>\n<p>I am the author :)<p>>I can only assume the author has not interviewed many candidates.<p>I did more than 100 interviews so far.<p>>I've lost count of how many tenured engineers I've interviewed who could not write basic code or explain basic programming concepts.
