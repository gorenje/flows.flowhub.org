I argue that a machine capable of replicating and improving itself, is something new?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465339\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465339</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"4aef79aae08d8778","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Will studying a new language interfere with any others you speak?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:44:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:44:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6266,"y":2776,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://psyche.co/ideas/will-studying-a-new-language-interfere-with-any-others-you-speak\">https://psyche.co/ideas/will-studying-a-new-language-interfere-with-any-others-you-speak</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465331\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465331</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"57127379c525d210","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Show HN: Mavex.ai – Your Personal AI Executive Assistant","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:44:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 10:44:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9182,"y":2440,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Mavy is your personal AI Executive Assistant which helps in scheduling and calendar management.

The last thing I want is the local artists, who do it for the art, to not see people's love and appreciation or to stop.<p>Around 5-10 years ago, IIRC the maintainer of a relatively well-known Linux distro moved home to (Minnesota?) because they had no health insurance and couldn't afford the Bay Area (or something like that, my memory is sketchy).<p>Also don't forget the sh-t-ton of abuse open source maintainers take.</p>"},{"id":"828620f6a9dcdf41","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jdblair in \"Goodbye to Thien-Thi Nguyen\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6694,"y":2496,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466262\n<hr>\n<p>I left before the acquisition, and then re-joined the team formally known as Cobalt at Sun in 2002.

I agree that perhaps the term \"reducing function\" isn't entirely accurate.<p>However, it's worth noting that transducers aren't strictly about sequence-to-sequence transformations. From its inception, the Clojure standard library was built upon the `seq` protocol, and all its collection functions were constructed using this protocol. If it were possible to implement the `seq` protocol on channels, it would address the issue. However, it's not feasible. When querying a channel about its next element, the only honest answer is, \"I can't determine that without potentially waiting indefinitely until the next message comes in or the channel closes.\" Turning the `seq` protocol into an asynchronous IO-bound process would be problematic. This is why transducers are essential.</p>"},{"id":"c375f1ac3f7a52b3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by petepete in \"A design system for the federal government\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3750,"y":2960,"wires":[["fdd20a67f55157f7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466257\n<hr>\n<p>I didn't even know anyone had attempted this, that's really interesting - thank you for posting the links.<p>In my statement you quoted above though, I was referring to the accessibility of components built using JS libraries.

Fundamentally they're rooted in the fact that population growth is peaking and <i>must</i> peak because the Earth is not infinite. You can argue about when it peaks and how high it can go, but it must peak at some point.<p>Population growth is the fundamental driver of GDP growth. Growth can still happen in other ways via innovation and efficiency improvements but without population growth it's going to be in the low single digits.<p>Without significant growth, retirement just can't work. Savings can't compound enough. Taxing the rich won't provide enough and taxing the middle class will kill the economy and make the problem worse.<p>Lastly retirement is really an institution that was born in an age when people did not live as long (on average) and work was much more physically punishing.<p>I could certainly see a kind of <i>semi-retirement</i> where a person dips out of high-pressure work in favor of lower pressure intellectual work that can be completed on a looser time frame. A lifetime of experience could probably be leveraged to provide valuable insight or work on high-value niche problems in specific domains, and that can be fairly lucrative and is often very amenable to remote part-time employment.<p>But regardless of things like that, this is a recipe for pretty significant social conflict. Young people already resent \"boomers\" for burdening them with cost via not just taxes but squatting on all the real estate and rigging the system to increase its value to fund their retirement. This will get worse, not better.</p>"},{"id":"c4d11fb70176d260","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by stoycho_st in \"Microsoft has not stopped forcing Edge on Windows 11 users\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:03:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:03:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7304.440716826136,"y":2744.3615977627937,"wires":[["3ffb0f57e69976e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466629\n<hr>\n<p>I am still Win 10 user for my home laptop, but was thinking that it's about time to try the Linux OS, as most of my friends did a long time ago.</p>"},{"id":"cb41756de72fb09c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jmclnx in \"Pentagon’s shameful effort to draft mentally disabled men to fight in Vietnam\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:03:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:03:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8172,"y":3104,"wires":[["b9a637d79a6136c4"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466628\n<hr>\n<p>Interesting read, and yes children of the privileged could easily avoid service.

Firstly, whether the company takes the data with your full knowledge and consent. Secondly, whether they use it in a transparent (or at least ethical) manner.<p>For the first of these, I quite like how on Android now the user has great control over what data is made available to which apps. The app needs to explicitly request access to camera, location, files etc... . You can toggle this on or off at will, and specify that it can only read the data while the app is active. I can imagine having regulation which enforces this type of privacy control for all tech service providers.<p>The second is much harder, because it's difficult to know what the company is doing behind closed doors. However we can at least check telemetry and demand that it is minimal and anonymised where appropriate. We can also apply much harsher penalties to companies that flout the rules.<p>Of course, all of this relies on government that acts in the genuine interest of its people and without hands in industry back pockets.

The FDIC insures bank deposits up to a certain limit (which was $250,000 per depositor per insured bank as of my last knowledge update in September 2021), so if you have more significant assets to protect, consider the following alternatives:<p>Brokerage Accounts: For investments, you can use brokerage accounts to invest in a diverse range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Brokerage accounts are not insured by the FDIC, but they may offer protection through the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides limited coverage for losses resulting from the financial failure of a brokerage firm (up to $500,000 with a $250,000 limit for cash claims). Note that SIPC coverage is not the same as FDIC insurance and does not cover market losses.<p>Insurance Products:<p>Private Insurance: You can purchase private insurance policies for assets like valuable art collections, jewelry, or other high-value possessions. These policies are often offered by specialty insurance companies.\nExcess Deposit Insurance: Some banks and financial institutions offer excess deposit insurance for amounts beyond the FDIC limit. However, this may not be widely available, and you may need to consult with your bank or a financial advisor to explore this option.\nInvestment Diversification: Rather than seeking insurance, you might consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes and institutions to spread the risk. Diversification can help protect your wealth from a single institution's financial troubles.<p>Consult a Financial Advisor: If you have significant assets to protect, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor or wealth management professional. They can help you develop a comprehensive strategy for protecting and growing your wealth while minimizing risks.<p>Legal and Estate Planning: Consider working with an attorney to set up trusts, establish legal structures, and engage in estate planning to protect your assets and ensure they are distributed according to your wishes.<p>Remember that the specifics of insuring assets beyond the FDIC limit can be complex and may vary depending on your location and the nature of your assets.

If you want a solution that works, the solution is usually quite simple. But if you want something that is fast, you often need to do platform specific things, and use fast paths for 'special cases' that occur more often than the 'general case'. These things together will make your code more complicated, but get better performance.<p>For example, memcpy can be implemented with a very simple loop, but platforms usually provide a much more complicated memcpy that uses vectorization and cache prefetching to get better performance. Compiler autovectorization can give you better performance, but it still cannot beat the hand-tuned memcpy in general.<p>Another example would be interpreters. You can write a very simple interpreter that works, but if you want better performance, you will need to throw in various techniques that may or may not be machine independent. And in this case, it is more about the algorithm and global invariant that the compiler cannot reason and optimize.<p>Note: I am not saying that all the code are necessary, I just argue that sometimes you need to sacrifice succinct code to get better performance, and this tradeoff is worthwhile for such a low level infrastructure that everyone depends on.</p>"},{"id":"7bdd4597c7b931cc","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by matthewfelgate in \"The End of Cheap Europe Flights?

Each prisoner has 10 bottles of wine, one of which has been poisoned. And each pirate has twelve coins, one of which is counterfeit and weighs either more or less than a genuine coin. In the room is a single switch which the prisoner may either leave as it is or flip. Before being led into the rooms, the prisoners are forced to wear either a red had or a blue hat. They can see all the other prisoner’s hats, but not their own. Meanwhile a six digit prime number of monkeys multiply until their digits reverse. Then all have to get across a river using a canoe that can hold at most two monkeys at a time. But half the monkeys always lie and the other half always tell the truth. Given that the nth prisoner knows that one of the monkeys doesn’t know that a priate doesn’t know product of two numbers between 1 and 100 without knowing that n+1th prisoner has flipped the switch in his room or not after having determined which bottle of wine was poisoned and what color his hat is.

And if I disable DLSS, if the game updates sometimes it enables it back so I see the horrible things again!<p>Why do you need AI to upscale anyway, why not just use Lanczo/bicubic/... upscaling? They are not only simpler and faster, but look better too, because they don't create horrible visible noise patterns like DLSS does.<p>Then they have the inter-frame thing that causes input lag, another bad degradation.<p>Then they 'solve' input lag by designing a vendor lock-in-sounding feature (Nvidia Reflex), while the real solution to input lag is not add vendor lock-in feature but simply ensure you compute 1 frame at the time and do so fast.<p>Then there is the fact that DLSS is something that needs to be supported by games themselves: why? This again makes it sounds vendor-lock-in-ish. But nothing about upscaling, nor frame generation, sounds like something that requires game engine support to me. The graphics card should have enough info to do that by having all the pixels. I mean, it was always possible to play games at different resolutions (DLSS is basically also like playing the game at lower resolution), and there always has been some upscaling required for that (whether it's the monitor or the graphics card doing it).

'hallucination' in models can be good. Imagine if the only prediction algorithms had to go through every point in noisy data, it would look like either some overfitted thing like an ugly high order polynomial that goes through every point or just a database of every x y pair in the training set. Neither of those ones hallucinate if you ask the data from the training set. But for most purposes they wouldn't be as useful as a fitted linear regression, which 'hallucinates' y values even if you give it exact x from the training set. Of course if you just want to memorize and repeat back the training set then just a database is the best way!</p>"},{"id":"a0c56027f97120b4","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by zbrozek in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:28:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:28:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5290,"y":3000,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466955\n<hr>\n<p>Folks really ought to be free to make their roof whatever color they want.

It also happens <i>in Jerusalem.</i><p>> When Jesus returns, He will be ready for war (Revelation 19:11–16). The nations will be gathered to fight against Jerusalem (Zechariah 14:2) in what we call the battle of Armageddon. But that will be the day Jesus returns: “His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south” (verse 4). It will be a unique day in the history of the world: “On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness . . . a day known only to the Lord—with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light” (verses 6–7). God’s enemies will be defeated, and the Antichrist and the false prophet will be “thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur” (Revelation 19:20). Jesus will set up His kingdom, and “The Lord will be king over the whole earth” (Zechariah 14:9).<p>> In establishing His kingdom on earth, Jesus will first set up a judgment for those who are still alive after the tribulation and who are on the earth at the time of the second coming. This is referred to as the “judgment of the sheep and the goats” or “judgment of the nations” (Matthew 25:31–46). Those who survive this judgment will remain on earth and enjoy a time of peace and prosperity with Christ for 1,000 years (referred to as the millennium; see Revelation 20:4–6). Those who are found guilty in this judgment are cursed and consigned to “the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Satan is bound and forbidden to act during the millennium (Revelation 20:1–3).</p>"},{"id":"e3120d033f924c7c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by polskibus in \"A LLM+OLAP Solution\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:32:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:32:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4651.191577009988,"y":1898.5733825927248,"wires":[["90b2e501917c626b"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467004\n<hr>\n<p>Has anyone attempted to use Doris or evaluated it against Clickhouse?

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"}]
