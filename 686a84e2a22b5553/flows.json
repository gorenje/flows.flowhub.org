He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings.

Often these are too small (code-wise) to even have private APIs, the internal behavior of the function is simply and necessarily too complex to unit test in the traditional way.<p>Some function behavior is intentionally and intrinsically tied to <i>temporal access patterns</i> in the API usage. Unless you can simulate a broad cross-section of real-world runtime API access timing patterns with your testing framework, you won't test all of the code paths. You often see this test problem with scheduler-like functions, where the correct function behavior varies based on internal resource pressures that are an interaction between temporal access patterns of the API and the runtime environment. It is a single function, self-contained, and quite simple, maybe not more than 100 LoC, but test environments are so sterile that usually only a single code path is actually used no matter what you throw at the API.<p>Some functions have critical code paths that dynamically switch strategies to mitigate when certain types of contention or resource starvation conditions are detected internally. These can be extremely rare cases across the set of possible inputs, such that fuzzing is unlikely to trigger them, or the set of inputs that can trigger them is dependent on exogenous environmental details e.g. the machine where the test is run.<p>As a fun side-effect, sometimes these functions do not have deterministic result. Getting the same result out of the function all the time does not imply correctness, you also have to know <i>why</i> you got the result you did.<p>All of the above does not apply to writing business logic in Java or similar. But for high-performance and/or high-reliability systems software, these cases come up often enough that it is a well-understood testing problem. Even if you expose all of the internal implementation detail to the unit tests it is not always possible to reliably trigger all the code paths from an arbitrary test absent purpose-built test tooling.</p>"},{"id":"eeb2d49071b38905","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by borbulon in \"Google Chrome just rolled out a new way to track you and serve ads\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:20:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:20:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6250,"y":1884,"wires":[["ce6e6eaa723b56e8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465598\n<hr>\n<p>I am against this and think it's pretty unconscionable, but I will say this in defense of Google collecting my data:<p>Google's entire business model is predicated on the fact that they and only they know who I am.

But this linked article is mostly clickbait.</p>"},{"id":"59ddc681fc9369e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by AtlasBarfed in \"The Carrington Event of 1859 and the Potential for a âMiyake Eventâ\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4747.111990502676,"y":3274.3502968683265,"wires":[["12d5ffe586ab18e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465866\n<hr>\n<p>Sooo.... widespread rooftop solar would probably help the resilience of at least domestic power?</p>"},{"id":"35f24ef46f0aa812","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ejb999 in \"GitHub education pack requesting real name on public profile\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6600,"y":2320,"wires":[["5e5672764b47c3e3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465865\n<hr>\n<p>what kind of calculators support 2FA?</p>"},{"id":"a18c1a8e87bcff26","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by motohagiography in \"Spainâs Lessons for American Decline\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:50:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8608,"y":2012,"wires":[["2aba6593bc6d376a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465864\n<hr>\n<p>Beautifully polymathic.

The code, with comments, is 35 lines of C.<p>Meanwhile, the regexp engine in Ruby 3.2.2, not even including the Regexp class visible to the language, is ~20597 lines excluding the headers.<p>They are not reasonably comparable, of course. Pike's code provides a very basic syntax which doesn't even support character classes, and does nothing to speed up the matching. The latter supports a very much more complex syntax, <i>and</i> is far faster for repeated or long matches.<p>But while Ruby's regexp engine is 588 times large than Pike's code, you of course get a vastly higher boost in overall system capability from those first 35 lines of code (from no regexp matching to some regexp matching) than the last 35 lines of code, or indeed the second 35 lines.<p>So if you have a small system and a small team, you work with that and start small and it won't be that surprising when you get a lot done in few lines of code, even though you have a long list of things you'll add when you can justify the extra resources (like those missing language classes, and a billion other features)<p>(Then you get a larger system, and you'll very soon find yourself wondering how you could manage with so little)<p>I think it's mostly surprising because most developers today aren't <i>used</i> to thinking about capacity constraints of small systems, and so starts designing for lots of features from the start (can't have regexps without character classes, and capture groups, and back-references, and ...).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/be...</a></p>"},{"id":"a2a0bf6cd32ff8ce","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by MrBuddyCasino in \"Removing Garbage Collection from the Rust Language (2013)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2420,"y":1540,"wires":[["5d148feff2f0c6f1"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465908\n<hr>\n<p>Tried Kotlin native?<p>- sum types via sealed classes (not great, admittedly)<p>- enum \"when\" expressions are exhaustive<p>- option type via built-in nullable types (honestly the superior solution)</p>"},{"id":"df79f4bee74b3d7a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by nobodyandproud in \"A guy preserving the new history of PC games, one Linux port at a time\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:56:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9562,"y":3840,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37465907\n<hr>\n<p>SteamOS came was indeed a failure, but I would have said it would fail in 2015.<p>Steamdeck, however, came out last year and it was a sensible choice by Valve to support Wine and Proton.<p>Youâre still thinking of Linux as a full OS and Platform, but Wine in 2023 makes Linux (or at least Steamdeck) as another device driver.<p>Steamdeck is also a poor platform for PC gaming which is why even Microsoft is getting involved, because PC gaming is a drop in the bucket compared to handheld and mobile.<p>If Valve remains committed with dedicated hardware and marketingâ-and this is a big ifâthen it becomes another power console and platform<p>The difference here is maybe Linux will get some of the crumbs and benefits.</p>"},{"id":"c180e9e7813dacb1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by rickdeckard in \"The End of Cheap Europe Flights?

The last thing I want is the local artists, who do it for the art, to not see people's love and appreciation or to stop.<p>Around 5-10 years ago, IIRC the maintainer of a relatively well-known Linux distro moved home to (Minnesota?) because they had no health insurance and couldn't afford the Bay Area (or something like that, my memory is sketchy).<p>Also don't forget the sh-t-ton of abuse open source maintainers take.</p>"},{"id":"828620f6a9dcdf41","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jdblair in \"Goodbye to Thien-Thi Nguyen\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9242,"y":2552,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466262\n<hr>\n<p>I left before the acquisition, and then re-joined the team formally known as Cobalt at Sun in 2002.

I agree that perhaps the term \"reducing function\" isn't entirely accurate.<p>However, it's worth noting that transducers aren't strictly about sequence-to-sequence transformations. From its inception, the Clojure standard library was built upon the `seq` protocol, and all its collection functions were constructed using this protocol. If it were possible to implement the `seq` protocol on channels, it would address the issue. However, it's not feasible. When querying a channel about its next element, the only honest answer is, \"I can't determine that without potentially waiting indefinitely until the next message comes in or the channel closes.\" Turning the `seq` protocol into an asynchronous IO-bound process would be problematic. This is why transducers are essential.</p>"},{"id":"c375f1ac3f7a52b3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by petepete in \"A design system for the federal government\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:32:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3750,"y":2980,"wires":[["fdd20a67f55157f7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466257\n<hr>\n<p>I didn't even know anyone had attempted this, that's really interesting - thank you for posting the links.<p>In my statement you quoted above though, I was referring to the accessibility of components built using JS libraries.

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>Youâll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with âHNâ in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a2e4374399cd027d","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"A more dynamic software I/O TLB","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:33:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:33:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":561.0683831659587,"y":4002.0073455918177,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/940973/\">https://lwn.net/Articles/940973/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461489\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461489</a></p>\n<p>Points: 61</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>"},{"id":"5755fd5931376043","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Tangurena2 in \"Why is the ocean salty?

I keep reading about these fantasies of pumping water from large rivers in the MidWest (like the Missouri or Mississippi) to the deserts of Utah or Arizona. The altitude difference is enormous - every drop of water would have to be pumped uphill at least one mile in altitude to get it from, say Kansas City (which is about 800 feet above sea level) up over the Rockies into the places were people should not be living. And what makes it worse is that the majority of water used in those states goes towards agriculture (82% in the case of Utah), where farmers pay less than 1% of the cost of the water they use.</p>"},{"id":"c7863fec23a57ce2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by topaz0 in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:46:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:46:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1523.7305261430115,"y":4965.27772642975,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466421\n<hr>\n<p>Several seconds is not an exaggeration.
