based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6206.440716826136,"y":748.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6054.440716826136,"y":2196.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5814.440716826136,"y":2524.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

He’s currently working to isolate and manufacture up to 13 molecules — with historical safety records — that, his research shows, interact with the right brain receptors to give that chilled feeling but with none of the toxic messiness that so often follows achieving that using alcohol.</i></p>"},{"id":"c00b80eb76974ae0","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by andrewpolidori in \"Google no longer offers new domain registrations\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 15:27:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 15:27:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1481.0724064431054,"y":3988.360141610794,"wires":[["5d4dbc03c4c2e7b"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37456743\n<hr>\n<p>What makes it so difficult to profit from?

Those are usually better, though of course nowhere near as good as a freshly-brewed cup.<p>What different about mass-produced coffee in Japan is that it leans heavily towards only mildly bitter coffee, not the hard bitter stuff you might get elsewhere. Convenience-store machine-brewed coffee is almost always pleasant and easy to drink unsweetened, which is not the case in many other countries.

framework which uses a vanilla std::deque for method pointers, and to add messages to the queue, the locking technique is a Benaphore (the original Futex, which uses an atomic and a locking primitive, with the twist that my locking primitive is a combo of spinlock/mutex based on retry count).  Nothing special. \n Benchmarks show that very rarely does the message push function block, and the chance of an OS context switch is also very low, so even though occasionally we get a locked thread swapping out, it is so infrequent that it doesn't justify the lock-free algorithm cost.<p>In a nutshell, non lock free queues are much faster than lock free queues, however you must be prepared to accept the very infrequent longer delay due to a context switch (where the lock is not available to anyone).  My benchmarks show that the price is acceptable since so much more performance is available with non lock free queues.</p>"},{"id":"c5341671f0bdb8ca","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by scubbo in \"Memories from old LAN parties\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:06:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:06:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2110,"y":4438,"wires":[["2e631d2017c4c8a3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457161\n<hr>\n<p>> Remains one of the few contexts where nerds would do drugs<p>Leaving aside the nitpicking of \"umm actually, caffeine is a drug\" (I infer from context that you mean \"hard\"/illegal drugs, which is reasonable), this one doesn't quite ring true for me.

This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457205\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457205</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b2d655528bafcb4a","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The quest to make a crystal harder than diamonds","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:10:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:10:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3750.717367224389,"y":3304.7142480458956,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"http://geologyscience.konfidenciale.com/the-quest-to-make-a-crystal-harder-than-diamonds/\">http://geologyscience.konfidenciale.com/the-quest-to-make-a-crystal-harder-than-diamonds/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457194\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457194</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"9081025fa102594f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Who was the real Amy Winehouse?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:09:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:09:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3734.6120498978003,"y":3800.2810858303965,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2a5f9ab-593d-4976-acdd-d031079a290f\">https://www.ft.com/content/a2a5f9ab-593d-4976-acdd-d031079a290f</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457190\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457190</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"9c7b0d7dc7b54bb","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Show HN: World Engine – Build Worlds Like Brandon Sanderson","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:07:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:07:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":null,"y":null,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Hey HN,<p>After hours of re-watching Brandon’s creative writing BYU lectures[1], we converted his ideas into a framework to rapidly iterate and build sci-fi fantasy worlds.<p>The app is divided into 3 sections:\n- World: To create a unique magic system intertwined with distinct physical and cultural phenomena\n- Characters: To create character arcs and give them unique traits that evolve over time\n- Plot: To weave a series of events in this world following the character arc<p>We are newbie devs, any suggestions on the app improvements and usability would be great!<p>The idea is to capture the essence of Brandon's approach.
