At pretty much the lowest part of my life after moving to a new town, we were gifted a pile of cards from one of my dad’s coworkers. It was the only thing keeping me going and more or less saved my relationship with my dad. It’s still, for me, the best game ever designed and in my 40s with 3 kids I still play and watch hours of content every week. Heck, we even have some hall of famers on our cap sheet at my current startup which somehow fills me with pride.<p>My son has introduced me to Yu Gi Oh and Pokémon but they both lack the fundamental elegance of MtG. It’s probably not fair to call Magic simple given the size and complexity of the rules at this point, but at the lowest level it really is just about combining simple things to achieve infinite variety. The best cards have short text and chime nicely with the theme of the card and wider story. The worst are like Yu Gi Oh, a page of complex tiny text that tries to do too much.<p>One of the saddest things is that, as you become better at the game with a deeper grasp of the rules and the cards, you never really recapture that feeling of the early days, when every card was exciting. Draft comes close (picking cards from random booster packs to try and piece together a deck) and Cube certainly captures the nostalgia (drafting with packs made of your favourite or most powerful cards). But still the smell of an opened booster takes you back.<p>Wizards has made many mistakes over the years and but Magic is extremely healthy and several recent sets have been all-time greats. Both Magic Online (the ugly but fairly complete online client that has _every_ card) and Arena (the more modern client that’s a bit simpler and easier to play but only has recent stuff) are actively maintained so you can play anything, anytime.<p>My only sadness now is that I never really made it to the pro tour, but there’s always time.</p>"},{"id":"25354803696654b","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Farmadupe in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 08:26:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 08:26:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1100,"y":3500,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37453950\n<hr>\n<p>Out of interest, what could make such a design better than a traditional inductive motor?

That was also the year President Chiang Ching-kuo ended martial law. But the first parliamentary elections afterwards didn't happen until 1991. The first direct election of the President had to wait until 1996.<p>South Korea did democratize (in 1987, coincidentally) before becoming a high-income economy (in 1995) but it's not like they had hit a ceiling that could only be overcome with democracy, economic growth simply continued along the previous trend. (And in any case, President Roh Tae-woo was the handpicked successor of the previous dictator and got elected with 36.6% of the vote due to a split opposition, so his democratic credentials are rather weak.)<p>Maybe if authoritarian governments did work by having a single person making all decisions in the economy and you can only do what they think is good, there would be greater economic benefits to democracy. But the typical authoritarian isn't quite that omnipotent or that stupid, so decision making is still decentralized across different companies and if you have an idea that the government doesn't consider good but also not actively harmful, you may not be eligible for subsidies, but you can still try your luck raising capital from investors.<p>So I don't think China is ever going to encounter a ceiling where innovation becomes impossible due to lack of individual freedom. But they might democratize nonetheless if there's a power struggle between factions of similar strength (e.g. after Xi dies without a successor) who don't trust a strong government controlled by one faction not to eliminate the others, and thus agree to reforms weakening state power.</p>"},{"id":"c96079982d511254","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by permo-w in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:11:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:11:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":107.43559398627008,"y":966.3884627796888,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454184\n<hr>\n<p>40B tonnes -> 8B people -> 5 tonnes per person per year -> 13.6kg a day per person<p>is 40B including the offset from photosynthesis?</p>"},{"id":"d20a4811cd81182","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jjgreen in \"Ask HN: When Ada/SPARK, then why Rust?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:11:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:11:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2988.440716826136,"y":2292.3615977627937,"wires":[["63e9e6e6dfeb6b87"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454183\n<hr>\n<p>Ada job postings usually come with a \"Security clearance required\", less so with Rust.</p>"},{"id":"d7d7b546d7c71816","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by brazzy in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:11:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:11:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":107.43559398627008,"y":998.3884627796888,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454181\n<hr>\n<p>Nope, it's entirely electrically powered, so <i>can</i> be run without generating carbon emissions.</p>"},{"id":"5b64f4c07f74319d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by gibolt in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:10:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:10:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":107.43559398627008,"y":1030.3884627796888,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454180\n<hr>\n<p>While this is true, we eventually need to go net negative.

A forest is not just a bunch of trees, but an ecosystem where perhaps the most important part is the soil, which in the long term is the bigger carbon reservoir.<p>A lot of the carbon that first goes into the trees eventually ends up in the soil, which if left undisturbed (i.e. not used for farming) is stable and does not leech significant amounts of CO2.<p>Admittedly the downside of this is that such soil is almost absurdly fertile.

This levels the playing field between the overburdened and the lazy on one side and the well-prepared on the other.<p>From a personal point of view, however, I instinctively dislike the idea: trying to process and evaluate material in public is stressful, chiefly because it is so often in my experience presented in bad faith.

A blank sheet of paper is a scary monster.<p>There's a huge breadth and depth of non-\"desktop\" GUIs out there, some (like smartphones) are even wildly successful. It's good to explore them for inspiration. Some of my favourites:<p>- Arcan (<a href=\"https://arcan-fe.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arcan-fe.com/about/</a>) - I won't attempt to summarize, just dive in!<p>- SailfishOS (<a href=\"https://sailfishos.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://sailfishos.org/</a>) - mobile UI focused on interaction through gestures / swipes; I've used it as my daily driver for a couple years.<p>- Speaking of mobiles, classic Nokia UIs allowed you to navigate to a specific item in the menu by pressing the corresponding digit on the dial pad. Once you learned where a particular item is, accessing e.g. your SMS inbox was extremely quick.<p>- Apple Watch / WatchOS (<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/watchos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.apple.com/watchos/</a>) - I've always loved the idea of a device where one of the primary interaction methods was a wheel/dial of some sort.

Kind of amusing that the literal action of \"printing\", which today lives on as \"printing\" output to the screen, ends up meeting its roots with a name overload collision.<p>(If you're wondering, the function was eventually renamed to NSWindow.printWindow(_:) to solve this issue.)</p>"},{"id":"46037f9e58e4ad86","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by TreeInBuxton in \"Memories from old LAN parties\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:20:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:20:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2143.598516912398,"y":3465.2163206951245,"wires":[["2e631d2017c4c8a3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454223\n<hr>\n<p>There is also Insomnia's smaller sibling LAN, \"StratLAN\" - captures the old school small LAN feeling a lot more!</p>"},{"id":"9b90a4b96513f5a2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jalk in \"Nginx Unit – Universal web app server\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:20:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:20:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2283,"y":2892,"wires":[["b6316967248c1093"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454222\n<hr>\n<p>Nginx-unit is reconfigurable using REST: <a href=\"https://unit.nginx.org/controlapi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://unit.nginx.org/controlapi/</a></p>"},{"id":"5cd9350bb0d74753","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by IshKebab in \"No Google Topics in Vivaldi\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:20:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:20:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":502.44071682613594,"y":1580.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454221\n<hr>\n<p>It <i>isn't</i> tracking.

Last year, almost 50,000 people in the US took their own life – one death every 11 minutes – and the nation now has one of the highest rates of wealthy, developed countries. (For comparison, the UK suicide rate is around 25% lower than that of the US).<p>\"Last year, almost 50,000 people took their life\" -- did they? Or was that the year their death was registered? Did the covid pandemic create a backlog that caused deaths to be registered later?<p>\"the UK rate is around\" - but they link to an old release of the data, and it's for England and Wales and does not include Scotland and Northern Ireland.<p>This paragraph has two links, and compares them. The first link is to \"Our world in data\" and the second is to the UK's ONS. These count death differently, you cannot directly compare them. In England and Wales the ONS defines suicide as \"which includes deaths with an underlying cause of intentional self-harm (ages 10 years and over) and deaths with an underlying cause of event of undetermined intent (ages 15 years and over).\", but the CDC's definition does not include that \"undetermined intent\" bit. In the US suicide definitions require intent to die.<p>The article then has a bunch of speculation about potential mechanisms for pollution to be causing suicide, and not one mention of poverty.</p>"},{"id":"b44c083b51dfb2c8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by tsimionescu in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:32:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:32:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":107.43559398627008,"y":1382.3884627796888,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454269\n<hr>\n<p>I disagree.

It's almost like using a shovel to take water from a leaking pipe and move it to a nearby puddle: lots of effort for little gain, and there's no guarantee that the puddle won't connect back to the leak.</p>"},{"id":"338b54f18ddd09a8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by 9dev in \"Nginx Unit – Universal web app server\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:32:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 09:32:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2283,"y":2988,"wires":[["b6316967248c1093"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454268\n<hr>\n<p>Heh.

Have you ever held an Olympus OM1 or 2 in your hand? Beautiful, and it’s insane what they managed to fit in such a small package. But “mechanical” is not where our world of solid state electronics is heading. Even if one of the camera manufacturers had an incentive, I imagine remaking their older cameras isn’t really possible. The tooling is gone, obviously, but so is the knowledge… like Ricoh/Pentax is rumored to have a new Film camera in development and they had to bring back guys from retirement. And they went for a less complex compact, not an SLR. Now that they all went mirrorless for their digital offerings, the manufacturing competence for the prism and mirror unit will dwindle fast.<p>Like you I hope someone manages it.

This means that your power bill wouldn't double or triple, it would quadruple even in countries like Germany where electricity prices are already high. Even if you believe in capture, you will have to quit coal and go with gas simply because that one only triples the price of electricity. You will also have to get the energy from somewhere. In fact, most of the cost of the carbon capture and storage will be in generating renewable energy to run the capture process to begin with.

It’s in the <i>examples</i>, but not the actual schema definition. The way success or failure is <i>actually</i> indicated is by HTTP status codes. 200 is success, 400/404/500 is error. So, they seem to set very bad precedent in at least one of their response and their schema.<p>But I was expecting it to be something like {\"success\": string} | {\"error\": string}, which is frankly a perfectly reasonable way of doing things: an untagged, but still unambiguous, union. It can make for quite pleasant code, too: `if response.success` and such.<p>You’re looking for a tagged union, something like {\"result\": \"success\" | \"error\", \"message\": string} (or alternatively like {\"result\": \"success\", \"message\": string} | {\"result\": \"error\", \"code\": string, …}), which is also a perfectly reasonable way of doing things. In some ways it can be viewed as more principled, as it <i>more formally</i> allows you to check the tag.<p>Really, the two approaches are much of a muchness. They each have their strengths and their weaknesses.

By comparing the positions of the first differing characters in strings, attackers can infer the contents of hidden strings. Timing attacks can take various forms, including statistical analysis, introducing random delays, or employing fixed-time comparisons as countermeasures. To mitigate timing attacks, the article introduces the approach of implementing constant-time string comparison and provides an example code. Constant-time string comparison eliminates timing variations, effectively preventing attackers from leveraging timing differences to extract sensitive information from compared strings.<p>Here's my attempt at using chatgpt to help me write a blog, looks good.</p>"},{"id":"77d0c3da4d96ca42","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sylware in \"All-AMD Ryzen Notebooks for Linux Gamers: USB4, AMD GPU? and PCIe-Gen-4.0\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:25:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:25:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1704.440716826136,"y":3100.3615977627937,"wires":[["84f28ba87843217f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454524\n<hr>\n<p>$215 cheaper without windows?<p>Why I have been told windows OEM price is around $20 all along?

The software could be run on top of another OS or natively (without any other OS)… making it very flexible. The demo includes loading the same software onto 2 different OS's without recompilation (using the same floppy). The portability was achieved by writing a small virtual (under 120KB) virtual processor so that the software always sees the same hardware/processor. The virtual processor was easy to write. The small size of the virtual processor means it had no effect on the speed of the machine... and in fact the demo's Bill shows us run much better on the virtual processor than on Windows or Linux. It is unclear how much progress was made on AmigaDE after this.. but the explanation appears similar to the one Bill gave when demoing OS5 (the ACE demo actually has a lot more detail).</p>"},{"id":"10c2b1df3b7752d3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sfn42 in \"All-AMD Ryzen Notebooks for Linux Gamers: USB4, AMD GPU? and PCIe-Gen-4.0\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:21:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:21:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1704.440716826136,"y":3132.3615977627937,"wires":[["84f28ba87843217f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454507\n<hr>\n<p>Well good luck with that.

The need to create order from chaos and give morality and purpose to the blind amorality of nature leads cultures to collectively develop these opinions. They just happen not to be primarily supernatural in the modern context.<p>The beliefs around \"Money\" are equivalent to those around gods - that the free market determines the true value of human life, that work ennobles the soul, that poverty is the result of moral fault and wealth of moral virtue. Money mediates the uncertainties of life in the same way people once believed rituals and prayers did. Money in many ways represents the animating spirit of modern civilization the way gods once represented the anthropomorphization of the natural world, in both its benevolence and cruelty.</p>"},{"id":"51601cea50e99da0","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by NoZebra120vClip in \"'God' is the mean opinion of your tribe\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:36:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:36:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1090.440716826136,"y":2836.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454582\n<hr>\n<p>I said we can never <i>fully</i> know His essence and nature.

Again, Mother Nature doesn't care, programs with either kind of unsound nonsense malfunction, the fact that one kind is written down on paper and the other isn't makes no practical difference.</p>"},{"id":"238bcac799481cc8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Fnoord in \"Using LD_PRELOAD to cheat, inject features and investigate programs\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:48:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:48:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3374.440716826136,"y":3700.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454634\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"a7476f00359a4af2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by tamimio in \"Asteroid behaving unexpectedly after NASA's deliberate Dart crash\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:47:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 10:47:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1056.440716826136,"y":2124.3615977627937,"wires":[["335bf7ceb97b0143"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454633\n<hr>\n<p>So few kids and their high school teacher found something that NASA team -who slept well at night after the mission- couldn’t find?

Tiling window managers and their often bundled 'tags' approach to window management offer a simplicity that is comforting in its constancy to me, the user. To sum it up, they make me feel 'at home' using my computer. Comfy goes beyond familiarity though.<p>I never have a mess of windows to deal with across my monitors, where I'm constantly needing to look at a taskbar, minimizing and un-minimizing programs (or looking through a stack of 'shaded' windows in the author's case). Each of my frequently used programs has its own tag, or shares a tag (visually as a tile) with other programs. While the programs I have open at any one time change, their locations don't. Everything in its right place, I always know what is where. I switch between all programs directly with ease with no intermediate interruptions to occupy my attention, my hands never leaving my keyboard. No 'looking' for stuff. Switches happen instantly because there are no transitions or any other forms of detectable latency (and for that matter, no compositor either). Combine all this with extensive use of scratchpads for ad-hoc and exploratory tasks and all the bases have been covered. Comfy.</p>"},{"id":"29c8cc59ac1b96af","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by franciscop in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:04:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:04:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1100,"y":4236,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454726\n<hr>\n<p>Oh I was just going to comment that those looked like some sort of brushes and thus that would negate other advantages, but after reading your comment and carefully reading the notice yeah that is definitely great!

When we feel anger, that's our brain's best guess as to the appropriate interpretation of a bunch of internal measurements -- raised blood pressure, high arousal, etc -- based on context. The same internal state in a different context could be interpreted as a different emotion, so there is no consistent biological fingerprint behind a given emotion.<p>It's counter-intuitive, but it fits better with what we know about how the nervous system works than the commonly accepted fingerprint idea.<p>Emotions are the brain's best guess at interpreting and accounting for our body's energy budget, nothing more and nothing less.<p>Combined with other ideas in the book (How Emotions are Made) such as the idea that humans regulate each other's nervous systems, I found this to be a game changer in terms of overall mental health. Having a word for something makes it less anxiety-provoking, the moreso the more coherent the conceptual framework behind the word.

It’s far more targeted towards application programming than anything else, although it’s looking better and better for embedded as well. Although it can probably be used for safety critical applications in the future, it’ll need better tooling before that can happen.<p>Anyway, the primary issue with Ada/SPARK in the (F)OSS ecosystem is primarily due to the lack of available compilers IMO. On top of that it has a reputation as a somewhat “dead” language and, as silly as it is, many people can’t bring themselves to look past the pascal style syntax. That said, Ada/SPARK is not the only game in town. JML exists for Java, Frama-C and Astrée can basically offer equivalent functionality, and I’m sure others exist (ployspace code prover?). So you might as well ask “why Ada/SPARK?”.<p><i>Why does our industry get so enthused with shiny new things, repetitively?</i><p>Personally I believe that Rust appeals to many who have historically avoided native development because C and C++ are just such a bother to deal with.

I found some pictures from an event in a shoe box when I was clearing out my parents' attic a few months ago. I don't understand how any of us ever convinced a woman to have kids with us.<p>Same...<p>My younger brother was still living with my mom...  Once a year, around Easter vacation, our mom would leave for two weeks.  We'd all (brothers and friends) load up our cars with 'em PC tower and CRTs and set up a LAN at my mom's home.  Some of us didn't have cars, so those who did would go and fetch the others.<p>We'd play mostly Half-Life mods (lots of time on the \"small\" map: the little one kinda happening mostly inside a little house), Warcraft 2 and then the Counter-Strike beta when it came out.<p>Sometimes some parent would drive his kid and check that we weren't doing heroine or something and make sure their kid could stay sleep at night.  Then tere weren't enough beds of course: so it was sofa, floor, FIFO queue for the beds etc.<p>Twenty meters long ethernet cables from the 2nd floor to ground level, hanging in the stairway.<p>I still have one of the Ethernet hub (yup, hub, not switch) from back then: a 10 Mbit/s Farallon hub.  Still working fine (I'm not using it but I tried it with some 1 Gbps to 100 Mbps then some 100 Mbps to 10 Mbit/s and then eventually that old hub).  Geez did many orcs and firearms shots transit through that hub!<p>Sadly I only have one picture from that era and it's only showing three CRTs and three people playing, zombie-faced (due to a very real lack of sleep): not the cabling or overall mess.<p>Then there were the food orders: <i>\"Who goes buy eight kebab this time?\"</i>.  Pizza boxes everywhere.<p>And then the panic two weeks later when our parents were on the road back to their house: a few hours to clean all the mess we left for 15 days.<p>Not just girlfriends: girls who wanted to hang out with us and maybe become girlfriends and we wouldn't even look at them...  With all of us only understanding years later that, well, maybe for some reason they kinda liked us.  So they'd drop at the LAN hoping to chill with us, but we'd just play the games nearly 24/7 and eat junk food, not understanding that we weren't very nice to them.<p>I remember the PC / GPU I'd take being a bit underpowered at first, so I'd mod Counter-Strike not to cheat but to have simpler models: characters made of very simplistic cubes...  Game would then render faster.<p>And the sneakernet going strong: when we wouldn't be playing, we'd be hooking HDDs in the same tower and be copying directories.<p>We also had HDD \"trays\" to make copying simpler (who remember these?).<p>Speaking of reinstalling Windows as in TFA: we had a pirated copy of Ghost, before Norton were to acquire it.  In german (none of us would speak german).  And we'd image the entire C: drive as soon as Windows was cleanly installed, with all its drivers etc.  Re-installs were then faster.  My roommate (whom I'd take to the LAN with me of course) once mistakingly \"imaged\" his broken C: drive to his D: drive where he had all his backups.  I remember him being highly pissed off.<p>What an era.</p>"},{"id":"1d8d9a7040e24ae6","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by slow_typist in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:32:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:32:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1100,"y":4364,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454866\n<hr>\n<p>Nice job, now magnet free generators for windmills please.</p>"},{"id":"dcf275e63e016216","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by bettercallsalad in \"Lithium discovery in US volcano could be biggest deposit ever found\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:32:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:32:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2010,"y":744,"wires":[["203aa61f1012182a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454865\n<hr>\n<p>> Of course the US can do whatever it want's in 20 years with enough money.<p>Are we sure US can anymore?

At the first the promo flyers hinted that if you get vaccinated you won’t get Covid, you won’t spread it, you won’t get sick , you won’t go into the hospital, you won’t die. Over the next year from when they became publicly available the literal flyers and posters slowly changed from expressing the above, one by one the hints were removed until it was just “ You won’t go to the hospital and die” And now? The posters are gone.<p>These vaccines were never studied to reduce transmission (they don’t). I got my first case of Covid from a vaccinated coworker ( I’m still “unvaccinated” and will be for life). A year later Pfizer admits some of their deceit during European proceedings.<p>Furthermore, I will turn your phrase that it’s wrong to “do what I want” when it hurts others. Let’s forget about the grievous discrimination, slander, and hatred I suffered as I continued to serve on the frontlines (hero to zero!). People have legitimately been vaccine injured. Sometimes servely sometimes not, but a lot of those people were forced to do what you wanted (mandates, peer pressure, public hatred) and they got hurt. They got hurt with a forced experimental medical treatment that was presented as totally harmless, super duper studied and safe, extremely effective. Each pf those points are lies but a lot of people made a lot of money and power, so that’s good. Have you looked into how they calculated how the vaccines lowers your risk of death? Look at the actual numbers? 15 people died in the control arm, 14 in the vaccinated; ergo it’s  highly safe and effective.<p>As to masks, highest quality evidence says that they are for show at worst or at best , nobody knows that they do anything so mandates are silly .

There are big systems (Amadeus, Sabre, mostly) who manage flight-reservations for big airlines. But it's a bit expensive, and airlines usually also offer their own reservation-systems now. There are also lowcost airlines and charter flights which are normally not available through them. But probably 90% of commercial flights in the western world happen through those reservation-systems.<p>And Hotels have a similar situation. You can theoretically book hotels, and even trips with train, ships, buses or cars through the centralized systems, but usually only the big companies are available through the reservation-systems. This has mostly historical reasons, but also because it's expensive, and is a bit complicated.<p>This is why alternatives like booking.com emerged, who are cheaper, and could adapt faster to the changing market. Amadeus & Sabre are annoyingly old and \"heavy\" in how they operate. Though, this all is changing slowly. The travel-industry is trying to move to new APIs for handling modern demands of travelers. And The old gangsters have started to branch out to web-stack, with JSON and restful APIs, offer free documentation on Github and youtube, and even have discord now.</p>"},{"id":"839752f1fe168917","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by helpfulContrib in \"It's my Monitor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:43:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:43:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":830,"y":2008,"wires":[["798773940ebe44c3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454930\n<hr>\n<p>The whole point of the PC ugprade was so that we could stop draping wire everywhere we wanted a terminal to go, and just use 10Base-T, i.e. \"one cable to rule them all\" (lol,  kthxbai...)<p>So yes, he did get both, but it did require me to pull one last strand of RS232 a week before we had to do it all again for the 10Base-T, and my manager was not amused at how I'd multiplied the work for myself; and especially wasn't stunned by my smart-ass quip that, \"if only he'd demo'ed the PC thing to Mr. Nasty Exec in the first place, things would've gone smoo .. oh, okay, I'll be on my way to pull that last strand, then ..\"<p>Yeah, wasn't really a great idea, it was only a week later that I saw that old Hazeltine, forlorn once again, sitting on the cart to be carried away.. oh how I wish I'd kept a few of those, myself ..</p>"},{"id":"4ddf63c62ba3cfbe","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by amelius in \"A guy preserving the new history of PC games, one Linux port at a time\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:43:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:43:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2442.440716826136,"y":3220.3615977627937,"wires":[["90b9b1d5c7b39587"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454929\n<hr>\n<p>In theory, can't an LLM be used to translate code from the original platform to the emulation environment, in such a way that there is no copyright infringement ?</p>"},{"id":"68c025a66d5b74bb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by zoky in \"Breathing Life Back into a Minitel 1B with the Minimit\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:42:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:42:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3103,"y":4424,"wires":[["642bb8c0bebfe606"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454927\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"8c33b25b77fb5c7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jmartrican in \"Common garden weeds in Southern California\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:42:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 11:42:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":940,"y":796,"wires":[["bc238a2f9eef0f76"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37454926\n<hr>\n<p>Some of these weeds help the soil.

That said, if you want to transition to sales, with 17 years experience (assuming no sales) this is probably your best option. The pay cut is typical, the upside is real, IF you can find product market fit. Sales is not presenting a solution, it's asking questions to find the problem and more importantly finding the person who the problem affects financially the most. It's a lot of fun and a unique skillset. I'd say not closing a single deal last year is a warning sign. I'd evaluate what you would do differently. Be objective and critical about why you will produce different results.

Drivers are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their logs (using state specified hardware and methodologies), and are punished for driving unsafely, or attempting to hide unsafe driving.

And there's also companies doing and implementing things only for the PR, or to remove heat from themselves, or preemt such things, and what have you. But I still wouldn't go so far as to write the entire topic off because some people are panicky and a lot of companies have financial incentives to earn more regardless of morality.<p>I do agree that, on the current course, I can't see humanity lasting very long, so to speak... that is, if nothing is done about it. Sure, perhaps nothing will work out. Perhaps everything will fix itself if one ignores the problem. Perhaps the fictional student ends up passing either way. Perhaps it won't. But is that reason enough to simply brush our hands of it? To just let it happen? Sitting back and doing nothing won't make things better either. Doing something has—at least—the potential for change, whether good or bad.</p>"},{"id":"b2bd89cec545fc07","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by FollowingTheDao in \"What is an emotion?

I can't believe I missed it when he wrote it.<p>I followed Rust in the very early days and definitely came away with the sense in this article. I would have said (and may have said to some people) that Graydon is really great, but that the exciting things about Rust weren't the things he liked or cared about; basically the expressivity and zero cost abstractions sections of this article.<p>But reading the article he linked about first class modules, I think that seems pretty good, and I think he's definitely right about making borrowing \"second class\" without explicit lifetimes (or at least discouraging them more so than the language does today), and about existential types (I'm always surprised I don't see these more in library APIs).<p>I also had no idea he wanted built in bignums. In pre-1.0 (and pre-cargo) rust, I created a very incomplete library for that, and would have loved to have it built in instead. Also yeah, decimal literals would be excellent.<p>But I didn't find the async vs. green threads section convincing. The green thread implementation wasn't a great fit at the time it existed, and I haven't seen anything since then that convinces me there was some great solution available to make it work better. Async isn't great in rust, but it's a much better fit, and I think it <i>can</i> be used well. I have hopes that best practices developing over time and maybe language features or changes can push people in a more sane direction of usage (once it becomes more clear what that should be).</p>"},{"id":"78cf5c3918a79287","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by kranke155 in \"Morocco earthquake kills more than 1,000\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:17:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:17:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3342.440716826136,"y":2636.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455140\n<hr>\n<p>This planetary theory could just be a theory that has “unclear data at the time”, the time being now.

And unfortunately I could not send these keystrokes over the serial port.<p>I had considered attempting some sort of ROM hack to enable these modes all the time but never went through with it (also my main ROM was soldered to the board, not removable like some later models)<p>Eventually what I did was use a Teensy uC and a system of optocouplers wired to the keyboard matrix that 'pressed keys' in the right order at the right time to enable the mode I needed automatically on powerup. Timing was difficult as if I attempted to 'press' the keys too quickly or exactly together it would misinterpret or drop the commands.<p>Now that the terminal would auto-configure itself upon power on, a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B running Raspbian in non-GUI mode with a wifi dongle was shoved inside it and hardwired to the RS232 port (with a level shifter between the port and the Pi's UART) and I had this setup running a few small programs I wrote to display weather, stocks quotes, 'screensavers' etc.<p>I had the unit on my kitchen countertop by my coffee machine and for a while would turn it on every morning to check news and whatnot.  Something about it was just super satisfying; the limited information meant my morning coffee wasn't overwhelming- just the day's weather, a few stock quotes, and a few headlines pulled from the BBC.  All with this super cozy glow on the white-on-gray CRT.<p>Unfortunately I eventually pulled it off my countertop and cannibalized the machine for other projects.  The whine of the CRT wasn't something I wanted in my kitchen running all day.  The little keyboard was cute but the keys made any lengthy input tortuous.  And the power draw just for the nostalgia factor every morning didn't make a lot of sense when.  I have no idea what the power consumption was but the little guy could put off some heat that is for sure.<p>Sadly practicalities won out over the aesthetic.</p>"},{"id":"b2786ae5163c6436","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by mdorazio in \"The U.S. housing market vs. the Canadian housing market\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:40:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:40:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3174.440716826136,"y":3460.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455298\n<hr>\n<p>My point about the 30% rule for rent is that you calculate that based on <i>pre-tax</i> income?

Yes, I am ok, I am just moving on a higher plane of reasoning than pretty much anyone else currently.

Mathematics is not bound to a particular CPU or chip. Sure, you can make it run on one (or not, that would depend on your program).<p>Now, this has a lot to do with Rust. Rust is a particularly restrictive form of expressing yourself. It basically prescribes a very particular form of mathematics, and in return, promises you certain theorems for free.

And even then, the restrictions of that CPU are very much present.<p>What do you have in mind for an unrestricted language?</p>"},{"id":"f37a3b60ceb4af38","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by concordDance in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:59:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:59:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":107.43559398627008,"y":4678.388462779689,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455441\n<hr>\n<p>We won't know until we try.<p>Cheap reusable rockets seemed hard until SpaceX came along and made them routine.</p>"},{"id":"2284fdd39f3850b7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ricardobayes in \"The new Polaroid I-2 instant camera\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:59:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:59:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2146.440716826136,"y":2492.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455440\n<hr>\n<p>Don't bet against nostalgia though.
