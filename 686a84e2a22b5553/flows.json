How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6446.440716826136,"y":804.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5934.440716826136,"y":2180.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5366.440716826136,"y":2452.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

I thought that the categorization took the most time, but this year I timed it, and doing the imports took the longest (because I have multiple bank accounts, multiple cards) - log in, figure out how to export as csv, export, realize that I need to export with different settings, find that, repeat for all cards and bank accounts and transaction sources.<p>Does anyone know if there's something like YNAB that will allow me to do historical import via Plaid? Would pay $50/mo if it worked really well. I'm hoping there'd be something that'd allow me to get a historical import of transactions.<p>It'd be great if with one click I could get all of my transactions from every bank account and every card during the 2023 year, and including transaction details that exist on payment provider websites but not on the bank/card (e.g. Paypal, venmo, Apple, Amazon transactions where the detail of what the purchase was is not shown on the statement).</p>"},{"id":"7da394fc7c1e5ef0","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by marcus0x62 in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 14:27:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 14:27:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":117.43559398627008,"y":2290.388462779689,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37456091\n<hr>\n<p>That works really well until the trees catch on fire, which has been happening more frequently in recent times.</p>"},{"id":"27ec20181d76cfe2","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by insanitybit in \"Why you might want async in your project\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 14:27:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 14:27:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6502.440716826136,"y":2732.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37456090\n<hr>\n<p>That's what I'm saying.

The induction coils would need to be offset to produce torque on the ring. Yes, it would be less efficient because you are using power to produce the magnetic field.

That seems an oddly specific to you and frankly overly negative take. Are you ok over there?<p>They don’t have any structure info on Alcarelle, the synthetic designed by an Imperial College London team led by a guy who formerly advised and clashed with the UK home office on drug policy.<p>This quote suggests to me it’s more a cocktail than a single compound:<p><i>With Sentia I just wanted to prove that it’s possible to come up with a functional alternative to alcohol using botanicals, to establish the principle and get a conversation going, because really people haven’t thought the concept was viable or practicable, and likely haven’t heard of GABA either,” says Nutt.</i><p><i>Indeed, Sentia is just the first step in his objective to provide an ethanol-free, more controlled route to the pleasant feeling of tipsiness without all the grim downsides. He’s currently working to isolate and manufacture up to 13 molecules — with historical safety records — that, his research shows, interact with the right brain receptors to give that chilled feeling but with none of the toxic messiness that so often follows achieving that using alcohol.</i></p>"},{"id":"c00b80eb76974ae0","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by andrewpolidori in \"Google no longer offers new domain registrations\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 15:27:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 15:27:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1481.0724064431054,"y":4508.360141610794,"wires":[["5d4dbc03c4c2e7b"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37456743\n<hr>\n<p>What makes it so difficult to profit from?
