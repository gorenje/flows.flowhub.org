than the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) allows banks to cover, you'll typically need to explore alternative options beyond traditional bank deposits. The FDIC insures bank deposits up to a certain limit (which was $250,000 per depositor per insured bank as of my last knowledge update in September 2021), so if you have more significant assets to protect, consider the following alternatives:<p>Brokerage Accounts: For investments, you can use brokerage accounts to invest in a diverse range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Brokerage accounts are not insured by the FDIC, but they may offer protection through the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides limited coverage for losses resulting from the financial failure of a brokerage firm (up to $500,000 with a $250,000 limit for cash claims). Note that SIPC coverage is not the same as FDIC insurance and does not cover market losses.<p>Insurance Products:<p>Private Insurance: You can purchase private insurance policies for assets like valuable art collections, jewelry, or other high-value possessions. These policies are often offered by specialty insurance companies.\nExcess Deposit Insurance: Some banks and financial institutions offer excess deposit insurance for amounts beyond the FDIC limit. However, this may not be widely available, and you may need to consult with your bank or a financial advisor to explore this option.\nInvestment Diversification: Rather than seeking insurance, you might consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes and institutions to spread the risk. Diversification can help protect your wealth from a single institution's financial troubles.<p>Consult a Financial Advisor: If you have significant assets to protect, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor or wealth management professional. They can help you develop a comprehensive strategy for protecting and growing your wealth while minimizing risks.<p>Legal and Estate Planning: Consider working with an attorney to set up trusts, establish legal structures, and engage in estate planning to protect your assets and ensure they are distributed according to your wishes.<p>Remember that the specifics of insuring assets beyond the FDIC limit can be complex and may vary depending on your location and the nature of your assets. Always consult with financial professionals who can provide guidance tailored to your unique situation and needs. Additionally, regulations and options may have evolved since my last knowledge update in September 2021, so it's essential to verify the most current information with relevant authorities and professionals.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466542\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466542</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"6e5dbd525d0d013b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Best Practices for Terraform CI/CD","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:55:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:55:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6734,"y":1992,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://buildkite.com/blog/best-practices-for-terraform-ci-cd\">https://buildkite.com/blog/best-practices-for-terraform-ci-cd</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466538\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466538</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a7b7e4f8b3411272","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Vital Role of SSL Certificates in Safeguarding Your Online Experience","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:55:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:55:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5006,"y":3560,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@email.upzilla/the-vital-role-of-ssl-certificates-in-safeguarding-your-online-experience-cf2902c013a3\">https://medium.com/@email.upzilla/the-vital-role-of-ssl-certificates-in-safeguarding-your-online-experience-cf2902c013a3</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466534\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466534</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"1bdf5405a3b65baa","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Premium Tailwind Templates from the Makers of Tailwind CSS","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6450,"y":2888,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://tailwindui.com\">https://tailwindui.com</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466520\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466520</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"4b25742ffb8eba06","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"List of AI Chatbots","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6074,"y":1880,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chatbots\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chatbots</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466517\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466517</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"54ad570a6e792a9c","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Cache Eviction Strategies Every Redis Developer Should Know","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6938,"y":2888,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://redis.com/blog/cache-eviction-strategies/\">https://redis.com/blog/cache-eviction-strategies/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466513\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466513</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"550bd861cef8bcbe","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Show HN: Real-Time Fuzzy Chord/Scale Identification with MIDI and ClojureScript","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:54:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6182,"y":4008,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Hey HN!<p>I made this web app to help me learn some music theory in real time whenever I stumble upon happy accidents such as chords, chord progressions, or scales that sound good, all without breaking the creative flow.

It used to be that you would launch it and it was as highly-responsive as most native Windows apps of that era.<p>I'm backing to using it at my new job (Office 365 subscription with all the desktop apps), and it's literally unusable for several minutes at startup. The UI just stops responding while it presumably does some background sync. I can't even click a button and start writing an email. Confirmed on two different computers.<p>This is the sort of characteristic I'd expect from a junior dev writing an Electron app in his spare time. I don't expect it from one of the three flagship apps of Microsoft Office.<p>My current flow has become launching Outlook to send an email, then realizing what's going to happen, open Notepad++ to write my emails in, then when Outlook finally becomes responsive again after a few minutes, I copy-paste them in it. Every time I do this, I think less of Microsoft.<p>When did this change happen? How does something like this pass QA? \"Works for the QA guy on our 10Gbps LAN, therefore no problem\"?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467084\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467084</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"ba6fd7734b199025","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Nvidia's dominance in AI chips deters funding for startups","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:38:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:38:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6330,"y":2496,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-dominance-ai-chips-deters-funding-startups-2023-09-11/\">https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-dominance-ai-chips-deters-funding-startups-2023-09-11/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467081\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467081</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"28742a6d11208818","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"September 11, 2001 media synced in real-time","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:38:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:38:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5006,"y":2272,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://911realtime.org:443/\">https://911realtime.org:443/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467077\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467077</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"6d767d3e6548600","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Open-GOP resolution switching with VVC","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:34:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:34:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5702,"y":2160,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://bitmovin.com/vvc-open-gop-resolution-switching/\">https://bitmovin.com/vvc-open-gop-resolution-switching/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467028\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467028</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"550e8cd864e6a83a","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"What is the origin of the term “wild ducks” in IBM history and culture?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:33:38 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:33:38 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7078,"y":3392,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000024.html\">https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000024.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467020\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467020</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"17faf78ba0137841","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Let's talk about the step up auth RFC","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:31:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:31:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5662,"y":2104,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://ciamweekly.substack.com/p/lets-talk-about-the-step-up-auth\">https://ciamweekly.substack.com/p/lets-talk-about-the-step-up-auth</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466993\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466993</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"1dc8a7260172b603","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Show HN: The unofficial HN discord just hit 50 members","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:31:03 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:31:03 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6778,"y":2496,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>This server started a few weeks ago via some HN comments.<p>It's very unofficial!<p>There'll probably be some negative comments about discord.

I spent days loading software from the internet to it in minutes which was kind of miraculous. I programmed some graphics demos on it.

In particular, optimization is a truly open-ended task, which can consume however much CPU time and memory as you're willing to throw at it.  GCC and LLVM today are <i>much</i> more sophisticated than anything around in the 1970s or 1980s.  They will chew up the entire program, transform it into enormous (many megabyte or gigabyte) directed graph, and then spend hundreds of billions of cycles, exploring possible rewrites of this graph, that make the program faster or more efficient.<p>In comparison, early compilers, including the first C compiler, usually worked on a single statement at a time, immediately translating it into equivalent machine code.  It never examines the whole program together, as there wasn't enough RAM in those machines to do that.  This produces inefficient code, but it's very fast to compile.  Accommodating the memory limits machines like the PDP-11 influenced much of C's design.  It's why everything has to be forward declared, for example.  Less state needs to be kept to resolve forward references.  By the time your machine has a whole 1 megabyte of RAM, you can stop worrying about things like that.</p>"},{"id":"ea71cf64755f4b74","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by masklinn in \"Removing Garbage Collection from the Rust Language (2013)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:36:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:36:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2430,"y":1440,"wires":[["5d148feff2f0c6f1"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467932\n<hr>\n<p>Maybe but that was never actually a thing.

[1]<p>After 1993, before 9/11:<p>> Feeling that the authorities lost legitimacy after they failed to respond to his 1990 warnings, he concluded that employees of Morgan Stanley, which was the largest tenant in the World Trade Center, could not rely on first responders in an emergency and needed to empower themselves through surprise fire drills, in which he trained employees to meet in the hallway between stairwells and go down the stairs two by two to the 44th floor. Rescorla's strict approach to these drills put him into conflict with some high-powered executives, who resented the interruption to their daily activities, but he nonetheless insisted that these rehearsals were necessary to train the employees in the event of an emergency. He timed employees with a stopwatch when they moved too slowly and lectured them on fire emergency basics.<p>On 9/11:<p>> When a Port Authority announcement came over the P.A. system urging people to stay at their desks, and before United Airlines Flight 175 would strike the South Tower at 9:03 A.M., Rescorla ignored the announcement, grabbed his bullhorn, walkie-talkie and cell phone, and began systematically to order the roughly 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees in the South Tower to evacuate, in addition to the employees in WTC 5, numbering around 1,000.<p>> After successfully evacuating almost all of Morgan Stanley's 2,700 employees, he went back into the building. When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate the World Trade Center, Rescorla replied, \"As soon as I make sure everyone else is out.\" He was last seen on the 10th floor of the South Tower, heading upward, shortly before its collapse at 9:59 A.M., 56 minutes after being struck by United Airlines Flight 175. A total of 13 Morgan Stanley employees died in the September 11 attacks, including Rescorla, his deputies Wesley Mercer and Jorge Valezquez, and security guard Godwin Forde, who had collectively stayed behind to help others.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rescorla\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rescorla</a></p>"},{"id":"60fd78952163a91d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Klonoar in \"Removing Garbage Collection from the Rust Language (2013)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:43:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:43:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2430,"y":1480,"wires":[["5d148feff2f0c6f1"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468021\n<hr>\n<p><i>> For example, error handling is an area where people almost always resort to 3rd party libraries.</i><p>IME people mostly resort to those libraries just to avoid verbosity, since implementing error types is frankly boring and macros/etc make it a non-issue.<p>Some have neat context-attachment functionality that can be useful as well, though I've personally never needed it.</p>"},{"id":"ac51c90926d42a2f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by thom in \"My mental model of Clojure transducers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:43:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:43:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6590,"y":3448,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468020\n<hr>\n<p>Yes, I'm being pernickety about naming and then misusing it myself!

It definitely helps that you can perform the final step of whatever job you're doing and have full control over how your stuff is materialised, without any intermediate collections, but it still feels slightly secondary to me.</p>"},{"id":"e864f42c8fbaf1a7","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Ays to Escape a Container","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:40:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:40:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6554,"y":1936,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.panoptica.app/research/7-ways-to-escape-a-container\">https://www.panoptica.app/research/7-ways-to-escape-a-container</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467977\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467977</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"33b55db56c569fb2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Unbundling of Pinterest","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:39:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:39:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6822,"y":1936,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@besartcopa/the-unbundling-of-pinterest-8817f4b18ebc\">https://medium.com/@besartcopa/the-unbundling-of-pinterest-8817f4b18ebc</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467968\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467968</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5db4aabae2c2c98b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Try Hard, but Not That Hard","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:39:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:39:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7090,"y":1936,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/try-hard-but-not-that-hard-85-is-the-magic-number-for-productivity-6b5aa875\">https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/try-hard-but-not-that-hard-85-is-the-magic-number-for-productivity-6b5aa875</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467954\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467954</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"22ac562e4187f303","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"IRS will use AI to crack down on wealthy potential tax violators","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:37:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:37:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5006,"y":3056,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/09/08/irs-artificial-intelligence-tax-violations\">https://www.axios.com/2023/09/08/irs-artificial-intelligence-tax-violations</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467943\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467943</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"52c550876f0954e1","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"MIT's Building 20: A Masterpiece in Usable Architecture","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:36:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:36:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5454,"y":2608,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.resextensa.co/p/mits-building-20-a-masterpiece-of\">https://www.resextensa.co/p/mits-building-20-a-masterpiece-of</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467927\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37467927</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"30c58feae5edc1af","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by raxxorraxor in \"Google Chrome just rolled out a new way to track you and serve ads\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:49:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 14:49:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6250,"y":2684,"wires":[["ce6e6eaa723b56e8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468107\n<hr>\n<p>If there was only a single choice for advertisers to place a completely static banner on the page, they would still be happy.

There will be lots of disappointment, and the hype will die down.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c5090ba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c509...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/20/uk-global-race-produce-ai-chips\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/20/uk-global-r...</a></p>"},{"id":"7a0093870b503eca","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by NovemberWhiskey in \"HDMI ISA graphics card for vintage PCs by improving the Graphics Gremlin\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2160,"y":2852,"wires":[["3f30c40143df84bc"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468589\n<hr>\n<p>If you only want to drive the monitor in DVI compatibility mode, you don't need very much because the interface is (as you describe) fairly simple and electrically compatible - if you actually want \"real\" HDMI then it's much more complex.</p>"},{"id":"c3464052a5719860","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jimmytucson in \"Altering Python attribute handling for modules\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3058,"y":1420,"wires":[["bcabfb8a019ca6cd"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468588\n<hr>\n<p>There are more inexperienced users than experienced ones, so if it really does disproportionately affect inexperienced users, it’s an even bigger problem!</p>"},{"id":"3daea8b39750b0a4","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by airocker in \"Nvidia’s AI supremacy is only temporary\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5910,"y":2088,"wires":[["9033fc872cd70470"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468587\n<hr>\n<p>Inference will not work on cpu, I see 100 percent cpu frequently when doing cpu inference and we had to change to use GPUs for a large client.</p>"},{"id":"b1a5619b04078eb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by caydenpiercehax in \"Convoscope: Smart Glasses Intelligence Tools\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2829.269325438125,"y":1095.2365363749418,"wires":[["274b3c6ea7228562"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468586\n<hr>\n<p>Proactive AI is the killer app for Smart Glasses.

Being better technically and having better software is not enough long term for ridiculous profits, unless you have an extreme lock in. And in Nvidia's case, it is not even as if there is a wide variety of external software that has to run on any alternative. Most companies just need to run <5 ML frameworks and moving that inference to something cheaper doesn't sound too hard, and in any case puts a ceiling on what Nvidia can charge. Training will be harder, but at some level of expenditure threshold crossing, there will be enough money pumped into it by atleast the big clouds to put a ceiling on Nvidia margins there too.<p>The comparisons with Nvidia's long term GPU dominance are misguided.

Tobacco companies, for example, definitely used cutting-edge (for its era) agro-tech to increase yields, potency, etc since like the 1950s and earlier. Tech has been a tool for developing weapons, addictive substances, and useless consumer goods since the industrial revolution (at least). The history of technology is chock-full of abominations. For every \"refrigerator\" there's \"holes in the ozone layer\", for every \"golden rice\" there's \"Agent Orange\".<p>I 100% agree that modern consumer society is absolutely out of control, and that tech is a major driver, but I see this as an intensification of trends that have been in place for centuries rather than a paradigm shift from a previously benign era. As much as I love the various cultural trappings of 90s tech-optimism (and I do love many things about that era) I think it was ultimately kind of a delusion brought on by the complete global dominance of the US economic model (following the end of the Cold War), alongside the headiness of the dot-com bubble, rather than a clear-sighted vision for the future of \"technology\" (wherever you draw the line on what that is). Not trying to shame anyone who participated in that scene, or say that it was \"bad\" or \"wrong\", but I do think that we can't really afford to be sentimental these days.

Companies which want to enrich e.g. search with AI but don't need full \"chat\" capabilities are already looking for alternatives which are cheaper to run even if a bit worse in capabilities (ignoring training cost).<p>- For the same reason specialized hardware for inference has been a thing for quite a while and is currently becoming more mainstream. E.g. google cloud edge TPUs are for mainly inference, so are many phones AI/Neural cores. I also wouldn't be surprised if the main focus for e.g. the recent AI cores in AMD graphic cards would be inference through you can use them for more then that.<p>- Both AMD and Intel might be less behind then it seems when it comes to training and especially inference. E.g. AMD has been selling somewhat successful GPU compute, just not to the general public. With OpenCL being semi abandoned this lead to them having close to no public mind share. Through with ROCm slowly moving to public availability and AI training being more consolidated on the internal architectures it uses this might change very well. Sure for research, especially of unusual AI architectures, Nvidea will probably still win for a long time. But for \"daily\" LLM training they probably soon will have serious competition, even more so for inference. Similar Intels new dedicated GPU architectures was made with AI training and inference in mind, so at least for inference I'm pretty sure they soon will be competitive, too.<p>- AI training has also become increasingly more professional, with increasingly more often a small number of quite high level frameworks being used. That means that instead of having to make every project work well with your GPU you now can focus on a few high level frameworks. Similar AI architectures widely used differ less extrema then in the past and have less often big changes. Putting both together it means it's today much easier to create hardware+driver which works for well most cases. Which can be good enough to compete.<p>Even with all that said Nvidea has massive mind share which will give them a huge boost and when it comes to bleeding edge/exotic AI research (not just the next generation of LLMs) they probably still will win out hugely. But LLMs is where the current money is, and as far as it seems generational improvements do not come with any massive conceptually architectural changes, but just better composition of the same (by now kinda old) building blocks.</p>"},{"id":"5be6ff61a0e698ac","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by V__ in \"Humans didn't change the climate in the past 365 days, but that volcano did\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:38:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:38:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9108,"y":3728,"wires":[["9e47faa530768eaf"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468883\n<hr>\n<p>> this one volcano produced a warming effect on the planet equal to about 5.2 years worth of total global carbon emissions in one go, and it’s going to be stuck up there for over half a decade.<p>> If you believe that CO2 is slowly warming the planet, then the net result of this one very unusual volcano will be to fast forward global warming five years, and keep us at that fast-forward location for between five and ten years, and then will slowly abate.

This ensures that the media cannot cover the topic without hurting their own reputation and that people who discuss it will be in the out-group and less likely to be taken seriously.<p>You cannot stop people from coming up with crazy theories and talking to each other about them, particularly in the age of the Internet.
