It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5550.440716826136,"y":788.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5230.440716826136,"y":2252.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3526.440716826136,"y":2684.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Who brings 160 lbs of gasoline with them anywhere?  That's twice as much as an average cars gas tank.  How many people do you know that have ever brought any gas on any trip ever?<p>The \"advantage\" of being able to drive 12+ hours without taking a couple hours to charge is absolutely ridiculous.  It's not something people do or should do.  The only reasonable circumstance is if you're on a camping trip or something, and somehow driving hundreds of miles without passing a source of electricity- in which case yes, use a gas/ethanol car.<p>In my honest opinion, it's a ridiculous demand that you should be able to drive 800 km without taking more than 5 minutes to stop.  It's minimum 6 hours of driving, and like 30-40 minutes of charging.  It's petulant to complain about that like it's a real issue.<p>The real advantage is cost.  It costs a <i>lot</i> of money to get a large battery that can charge quickly, when a $20k Civic can do it.

Since aluminium production requires a constant energy supply, any fluctuation could have heavy consequences for the molten metal. The technology also ensures that grid power fluctuations do not affect the magnetic fields in the electrolysis cells.<p>This seems to be solving the even-harder problem of handling on-demand/dynamic fluctuations rather than planning for a diurnal cycle. I wonder if there is scope to use a heat reservoir (molten salt or similar) as a buffer for these sorts of process; basically if you need to dump heat into a process perhaps you can shift the heat production but leave the process itself unchanged.<p>Amusingly I was reading the wrong Wikipedia last night and it’s mentioned right there too:<p>> Particularly in Australia these smelters are used to control electrical network demand, and as a result power is supplied to the smelter at a very low price. However power must not be interrupted for more than 4–5 hours, since the pots have to be repaired at significant cost if the liquid metal solidifies.<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_smelting\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_smelting</a></p>"},{"id":"c9d564dc7e90376e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ho_schi in \"The Decline of Usability (2020)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:56:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 16:56:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1040,"y":1120,"wires":[["ba2e848a285a820f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457683\n<hr>\n<p>Apple?  \nThe people which removed the menu from the window and keep it separate to tease all users?

There's a reason why left-wingers use the word \"gentrification\" a whole lot. In many cases suburban home and car ownership is actually <i>cheaper</i> than the traditional urban lifestyle, for various reasons including but not limited to:<p>1. Supply being limited because America outlawed dense urban construction decades ago. Dense cities cannot legally expand to meet demand and building up gets more expensive and unrealistic after a certain number of floors.<p>2. People in suburbs being further away from lucrative jobs - i.e. proximity to one's work is priced into the cost of the home.<p>3. Various government subsidies and tax credits that distort the market to produce more resource-intensive suburban housing.</p>"},{"id":"4108b8af5b5ab09","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by xorbax in \"Lithium discovery in US volcano could be biggest deposit ever found\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:07:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:07:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":540,"y":1480,"wires":[["203aa61f1012182a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457787\n<hr>\n<p>The best part is that OP edited his comment to make it seem like he <i>didn't</i> argue that an exhausted battery consumed lithium<p>Fun!</p>"},{"id":"13c39d07f58b371f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by PeppaP007 in \"Show HN: World Engine – Build Worlds Like Brandon Sanderson\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:07:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:07:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5122.440716826136,"y":3636.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457786\n<hr>\n<p>Might wanna play around with the slider to make more continuous.\nSome loud & clear segregation in the modules would also make it easy for the eyes.</p>"},{"id":"343ad1f84d71e29b","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ShadowBanThis01 in \"The Decline of Usability (2020)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:07:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:07:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1040,"y":1240,"wires":[["ba2e848a285a820f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457785\n<hr>\n<p>100% on target.

Let me tell you, if we hit 96F two weeks from now, it'll be front page news and evidence of climate catastrophe.<p>I think everyone has now fallen into the trap of mixing up weather with climate.  We used to deride the deniers who said a cold snap meant global warming was fake, by pointing out that climate and weather are two different things.  But more recently we point to every heat wave as evidence of climate change, every cold snap as well -- because 'more energy means more extremes!'  Which may be entirely true, but it's hard to deny it looks like trying to have your cake and eat it too.<p>FWIW, back in 1974, the coldest day of that year was 12F.  That would also be considered quite cold today.  So that year hit some temperatures in both directions that would be noteworthy today, almost 50 years later.</p>"},{"id":"82a702661b0f31ac","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Freestyler_3 in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:12:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:12:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5350.440716826136,"y":1948.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457843\n<hr>\n<p>Same here.</p>"},{"id":"149a26f7a9fb3907","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by nickdothutton in \"It's My Monitor\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:12:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:12:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4102.440716826136,"y":2084.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457842\n<hr>\n<p>At a previous company, a startup, we made and sold Firewall software which was installed on either Sun hardware (Solaris/SPARC) or Compaq (NT/x86).

from a business standpoint.  Ad-supported sites could say \"we currently have no better business model than advertising, but we could make the ads less terrible if you help\".<p>Nobody does this because the trust is completely gone.  If you claim \"we can offer you crappy ads or better ads\", nobody really believes you'll do that, and there are some very dubious definitions of \"better ads\".  So people demand the financially impossible, \"no ads\".<p>There's also a lot more hostility towards internet ads than other media, in part because trust was broken very early on.  Bad internet ads are a lot worse than bad traditional-media ads.  Other media had effective limits on how obnoxious an ad could be: if you accidentally lingered your eye over the Kroger ad in the newspaper, it didn't expand and crowd out the latest Covid statistics.  The injury-lawyer ad on TV couldn't provide a vector for a zero-day that permanently dialed your set to Telemundo.  I also suspect there was a lot more \"ad curation\" in legacy media-- the ad choice still reflected on the publisher, and the cost of entry was high enough to filter out some of the most scammy ads.  (Could you pull off the \"Punch the monkey and win a PS3\" scam if you had to pay for high-quality print ads?)  The result: people who never hit the \"30 second skip\" button on their VCR remote are intimately familiar with uBlock Origin.</p>"},{"id":"356e8acbf0979e76","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by retSava in \"A Texas Semiconductor Boom on the Horizon\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:27:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:27:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1180.9224623660107,"y":4633.3439703426575,"wires":[["cabb637cf3b7519c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37457998\n<hr>\n<p>It's also exactly the kind of humor I love.

I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

The major concern with Nuclear is the <i>economic cost</i> of accidents not the deaths. Grid solar is by far the safest option per kWh, but we still subsidize relatively deadly rooftop solar because such low numbers of deaths aren’t a major concern for regulators.<p>Next both Nuclear and solar/wind want storage/dispatchable power to follow the daily, weekly, and yearly demand curve. Hydro can provide significant flexibility but scaling Nuclear means falling capacity factors mean higher cost per kWh.<p>As to battery backed solar, there’s several existing power plants that operate with the ability to store 40-50% of their daily generation capacity that are viable with current grid prices.  Significant renewable storage is therefore already cost effective as long as the source electricity is cheap enough.<p>Finally regulations don’t really explain the price differences alone when you compare different countries and they all have similar issues you need to look deeper. One example of a root issues is modern skilled workers simply demand higher salaries. Most industries have offset this with  higher levels of productivity and or outsourcing, but the Nuclear industry has completely failed here.<p>In theory many of these issues could be addressed, but current plans fail to do so in fundamental ways.

And to be honest, if it wasn't for the internet - made up of personal websites and real people sharing their own experience on forums - that taught me everything there is to know about Cluster B disordered personalities (just an example, <i>cough</i> nothing personal <i>cough</i>), I don't think I would be sitting here typing this lengthy response.<p>I realized I can not sit back, enjoy the decline of the internet, and only complain about it.

According to this article, caps and lids made out of plastic may be placed on the market only if the caps and lids remain attached to the containers during the products’ intended use stage. Tethered caps will become mandatory in the EU in July 2024.<p>Why is this a thing? Because plastic lids are made of a harder plastic that doesn't degrade as quickly and is much less recycled than the bottles themselves. How prevalent is this? In the last 30 years 20 million bottle caps have been found on beaches alone in Europe during clean-up work. They are in the top 5 ocean trash items that ultimately kill wildlife. This is only a small snapshot of the ultimate number of bottle caps not recycled aside their bottles.<p>To fix this, the EU suggest tethering the lid to the bottle so they're less easily lost and more likely to be recycled properly. 20 companies are responsible for the majority of throwaway plastics in the world, so this change is required in only a few places but could have a large net-benefit. Ultimately this is something that can only come from top-down optimization - why? Because it increases costs for each bottle.<p>> This new bottle cap design requirement must have created a new economy for producing these bottle caps for all of the containers, someone profited.<p>Companies lost money from this and tried to lobby to avoid it by trying ideas first, and then tethering if those failed.<p>> There are massive problems around waste that no one there dares to approach, so they make these weird directives that just smell of corruption and incompetence.<p>Why can't we tackle the small and the large?<p>> Many cities, to avoid fines, provide separate containers, but in the end just throw everything on the same pile.<p>Depends on the city/country, but the primary issue with lids is wildlife harm in my opinion so this does fix that issue.</p>"},{"id":"45cdd3029697c94a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by batch12 in \"Earth had hottest 3-months on record; unprecedented sea temps & extreme weather\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:03:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:03:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2038.3291598400685,"y":825.2482276712922,"wires":[["2cef94ce36463616"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458337\n<hr>\n<p>What works for you doesn't work for everyone.

A recollection of the late 19th century and early 20th, from 1930: <a href=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/01/get-horse-americas-skepticism-toward-first-automobiles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/01/get-horse-americ...</a><p>The whole story has salient parallels — parts suppliers were either reticent or inexperienced, fuel was cheap but not widely available, motors were slow, investors put money in before the market was there, founders lamenting the state of the modern laborer, early adopters stuck needing parts for vehicles orphaned by suddenly defunct manufacturers, and the guy getting all the money and attention is a wealthy idiot making self-crashing death traps who relies on free advice from his witless fans to avoid failure and profit. There's even a cameo from early EV manufacturer Electric Vehicle Company in 1899.<p>Tangentially, this is evocative:<p>> In the uncertainty of what the public would want, a great many strange contraptions were put together. Joseph Barsaleaux, a blacksmith of Sandy Hill, New York, built a motor horse. In his device, the horse moved on a single wheel about two feet in diameter, with the wheel attached to the shafts just as was a live horse. Reins attached to the mouth of the horse served as a steering gear, because the machinery was inside the horse and had to be regulated some way. The contraption weighed about 550 pounds, had a cruising speed of six miles an hour, and attracted some serious attention.<p>EV makers should probably stop trying to make mechanical horses — EV motors and cars that aren't competitive with ICE equivalents — and find a form factor that better suits both the market <i>and</i> the current state of the technology. Class 2 ebikes and small carts feel closer to that answer on short runs, but the long-haul equivalents are still missing.<p>Hell, Winton in this story is a bicycle manufacturer who makes his first horseless carriage from bicycles.</p>"},{"id":"1e6a603e85e63bb1","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by throwaway858 in \"“Make” as a Static Site Generator (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:02:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:02:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2630.945320427867,"y":1272.1097688511418,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458332\n<hr>\n<p>The shake build system (a general-purpose build system similar-to/better-than make) has a \"prune\" feature for exactly this purpose:<p><a href=\"http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2015/04/cleaning-stale-files-with-shake.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2015/04/cleaning-stale-file...</a><p>But I think the best solution (that also works with make) is to have a \"make dist\" target that creates a final .tar.gz archive of the result.

In fact give tax breaks to people who build them even. Basically the idea that in a time when mortgage rates are 7% plus on a 1M house, and somehow you can find a rental for less than whatever that would cost is so unlikely that you have tons of people fighting for the rare case when that happens. But with an ADU it’s just a random additional space that could easily house a couple of people and charging a low rent and low utilities for that seems super likely.

It's a better map that can keep some state.
