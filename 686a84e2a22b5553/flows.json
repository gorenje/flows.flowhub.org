the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4718.440716826136,"y":332.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2990.440716826136,"y":2436.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2422.440716826136,"y":3204.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

I'd prefer to go with some type of SaaS or local app that could make this as painless as possible for us or develop some sort of custom tool for ourselves.<p>So, as I don't really know much about shift planning software offerings, I'm asking you all. Any suggestions?<p>If I were to build it myself, I'd need some platform with an easy way to add all of employees and managers with different roles and the ability to group them into their own units. Then write some algorithms or functions to keep track of what shifts the workers have done and distribute the shifts evenly. It should be possible that every unit had it's own rules. Do you know of any low code platform that could work for cases like this?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462110\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462110</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"4731be6453514cf6","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Chemical Engineering Beyond Earth: Astrochemical Engineering in the Space Age","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:09:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:09:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3718.440716826136,"y":4100.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/17/13227\">https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/17/13227</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462048\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462048</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"788a45ddbaf53312","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Zadie Smith, Stephen King and Rachel Cusk’s pirated works used to train AI","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:08:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:08:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5242.440716826136,"y":3652.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/22/zadie-smith-stephen-king-and-rachel-cusks-pirated-works-used-to-train-ai\">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/22/zadie-smith-stephen-king-and-rachel-cusks-pirated-works-used-to-train-ai</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462044\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462044</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a31ff448d3b1ebf3","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Budgies Are Awesome: Australia Homeland of Budgies","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:25:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:25:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2570.440716826136,"y":2164.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"http://budgiesareawesome.blogspot.com/2010/10/australia-homeland-of-budgies-6.html\">http://budgiesareawesome.blogspot.com/2010/10/australia-homeland-of-budgies-6.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462136\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462136</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"cc785afd9040b9e4","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"RestGPT","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:22:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:22:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2402.440716826136,"y":332.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/Yifan-Song793/RestGPT\">https://github.com/Yifan-Song793/RestGPT</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462125\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462125</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"2bd143a0137c5833","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"On Salem Witch Trials","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:22:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 02:22:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5702.440716826136,"y":444.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owenbroadcast/status/1700672456397037898\">https://twitter.com/owenbroadcast/status/1700672456397037898</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462124\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462124</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"6be76ece9ee17926","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"China just took a $300B bite out of Apple.

Not all that much more pawerful, but more readable and more straightforward to write. Things are done with functions that take parameters and do things to the parameters, not with special syntax that does magic transformations of variables which you then parlay into various uses.<p>Everyone uses perl/python/ruby/php/whatever when the project goes beyond bash scope, but they all need to be installed and need to be a particular version, and almost always need some library of modules as well, and every python script breaks every other year or on every other new platform.

As traffic gets congested everyone naturally relaxes adherence to that policy since it's not realistic to uphold in all conditions.  I mean, if you have citations that support the argument that it \"fails often\" I'm all ears, but my lived experience with this highway protocol has been universally positive.<p>I observed that it especially works best in concert with a rule that people entering/merging from the right have the right-of-way, since this reduces uncertainty around \"who will go?\" that I often witness here in NA (where \"keep right to except to pass\" is merely a suggestion, or not enforced even if enshrined in law).<p>Regarding speed limit, I'm not arguing against speed limits or adhering to them, and indeed the more consistent the speed of traffic, the safer it is.  On that note, my observation is that simply adhering to the speed limit (and attempting to stay at that speed) means regularly passing vehicles -- that is, in most cases, people are indeed following speed limits and a \"keep right except to pass\" policy correlates well with maintaining consistent speed and flow of traffic.  People who want to drive slower can stick to the right lane without any hassle or problem (it's accepted and normal for them to drive slow there), and those who are driving faster can safely pass and then return to that right lane.  If there are deep flaws in this process, I'm absolutely not seeing them and have not observed them.</p>"},{"id":"3de4b6e97dff9bad","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by cout in \"Microsoft has not stopped forcing Edge on Windows 11 users\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:19:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:19:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7284.440716826136,"y":2624.3615977627937,"wires":[["3ffb0f57e69976e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462829\n<hr>\n<p>Interesting, reminds me a bit of 98lite which did something similar for windows 98.</p>"},{"id":"f53cf61a15696550","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by wolverine876 in \"The Le Guin Precepts\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:19:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:19:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4870.440716826136,"y":2324.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462828\n<hr>\n<p>helpful - very insightful and well written.

It allows people to continue with the way of life they are used to and feel good about doing their part.<p>When I say “get connected with the local ecosystem”, I am not espousing a hippie view.<p>Part of our modern way of life insulates us from really understanding what it means to be a part of an ecosystem or a community. I mean it literally: many people do not actually know what it is like to eat an apple off a tree, let alone a relationship with that particular tree, and all the birds, bees, worms, fungi, and microbes involved with that apple.<p>I don’t know how to say this any more literally and directly. Advocating for “doing something about CO2/warming” is so far away from getting your hands dirty, and knowing at a deep level, that this is our home, and we’re not the only ones living here, and that the land can very well provide healthy food, and our actions directly\nimpacts the land around us.</p>"},{"id":"dece4bf94cc995cb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by brucethemoose2 in \"Microsoft has not stopped forcing Edge on Windows 11 users\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:39:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:39:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7284.440716826136,"y":3024.3615977627937,"wires":[["3ffb0f57e69976e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462954\n<hr>\n<p>I used to be <i>ambivalent</i> about Edge.

Now days any politician seen talking to someone of the \"opposing\" party is deemed a traitor and vilified by the 24hr news media.</p>"},{"id":"9824b288a186eed3","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Everything I'll forget about prompting LLMs","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:36:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:36:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3494.440716826136,"y":1492.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://olickel.com/everything-i-know-about-prompting-llms\">https://olickel.com/everything-i-know-about-prompting-llms</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462933\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462933</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a63d58f851191c57","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Can large language models reason?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:31:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:31:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4298.440716826136,"y":1020.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason\">https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462899\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462899</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"1e3e38dd0c738915","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Is 12 Factor App Right About Logging – PPT","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:31:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:31:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3862.440716826136,"y":1492.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/philwilkins56/is-12-factor-app-right-about-logging\">https://www.slideshare.net/philwilkins56/is-12-factor-app-right-about-logging</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462896\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462896</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"892788a3bdfd73ea","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Confessions of a McKinsey Whistleblower","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:30:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:30:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2462.959199869709,"y":2507.144222909189,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/mckinsey-whistleblower-confessions/\">https://www.thenation.com/article/society/mckinsey-whistleblower-confessions/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462889\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462889</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"d760c233f53947d5","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by CameronNemo in \"Microsoft has not stopped forcing Edge on Windows 11 users\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:44:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:44:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7284.440716826136,"y":3104.3615977627937,"wires":[["3ffb0f57e69976e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462979\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"b2ca8952718f603","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by bradknowles in \"Improving NeRF quality by progressive camera placement\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:44:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:44:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4862.440716826136,"y":2276.3615977627937,"wires":[["63e39a55b1a18a8f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462978\n<hr>\n<p>I'm still thinking that a 3D video recording would be the best way to gather this information.<p>Don't worry about taking stills or optimal placement of the camera for stills, because all the information you need is captured in the process of taking a decent 3D video scan of each room.

Eg that unless something is obviously wrong you wouldn’t action based on any findings from a full body scan; instead you would retain the record and repeat the scan 12-24 months later. Compare anything notable for growth or other irregular change, rinse and repeat. I would imagine that would greatly decrease the amount of pointless imaging and biopsy done. There would certainly still be some done but is that not the case now?<p>I would imagine this is downplayed because us insurance companies are generally not huge fans of expensive preventative care procedures with little evidence base (and to the last point, fair). And additionally I’d imagine physicians and radiologists have some worry about the potential liability of things being incorrectly being labeled as benign or to be monitored and turning into malpractice claims.<p>So the evidence base gets established by rich people who can afford to cut insurance out of the equation and hire physicians that are open to these kinds of procedures.

I've recently started using Flow-storm [0], by @jpmonettas), and it's been quite transformative. You can still easily see the values flowing through your system (better than just \"prints\"), and it can handle multi-threaded / async scenarios quite nicely. You don't need to manually step through code, you can just \"see\" your data flow, and when you have loops or some other form of iteration, you can see the data for each pass. Coupling this with a good data visualization tool (such as Portal [1]) really feels like magic. I've been doing Clojure for quite a few years now, and was very happy with my plain REPL-driven workflow, but this is way better.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://github.com/jpmonettas/flow-storm-debugger\">https://github.com/jpmonettas/flow-storm-debugger</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/djblue/portal\">https://github.com/djblue/portal</a></p>"},{"id":"877ef4bb4c87baf8","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by khedoros1 in \"Ask HN: Why are most LLM libraries dead projects now?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:12:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:12:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5240.440716826136,"y":2268.3615977627937,"wires":[["e7ec59e82e2de078"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463138\n<hr>\n<p>Same person posted that thread as this one.</p>"},{"id":"8940ef71dc8f366e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by _3u10 in \"Why Does Flying Suck So Much? – Robert Reich [video]\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:12:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:12:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3550.440716826136,"y":2336.3615977627937,"wires":[["257176f6b83bca64"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463137\n<hr>\n<p>Fly in other countries.
