to the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7506.440716826136,"y":724.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7438.440716826136,"y":2204.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5226.440716826136,"y":2708.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

stalls out, I have to play hot potato over their incredibly long list of available exit nodes just to try and find one that will work for another 5-10 minutes before I lose connection again.<p>Maybe

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

When maximum torque is required, especially at low speeds, the magnetic field strength (B) should be maximum – so that inverter and motor currents are maintained at their lowest possible values. This minimizes the I² R (current² resistance) losses and thereby optimizes efficiency. Likewise, when torque levels are low, the B field should be reduced such that eddy and hysteresis losses due to B are also reduced. Ideally, B should be adjusted such that the sum of the eddy, hysteresis, and I² losses is minimized. Unfortunately, there is no easy way of changing B with permanent magnets.\n</code></pre>\nEssentially, this new tech combines the best of Permanent Magnet Brushless DC and Induction motors. It allows you to change the magnetic field B without contact.<p>The losses in the shaft coils are low when B is low so the gains in efficiency for an \"eco mode\" would be excellent as you modulate B for low torque and you would still retain the ability to crank up the power in a \"sport mode\" at the cost of efficiency.<p>[1]<a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-motors\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-mot...</a></p>"},{"id":"66010987e5160685","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by askonomm in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7438.440716826136,"y":3212.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458833\n<hr>\n<p>In Estonian motherboard is emaplaat.</p>"},{"id":"9f308a278c10dd36","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by weinzierl in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:56:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5370.440716826136,"y":1908.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458832\n<hr>\n<p>I always had a strong interest in security and that's the direction I developed even when still in automotive.

Senior engineers should be able to talk to design about a redesign necessary because iOS just isn't capable of this it turns out or the cool effect you saw is only available on a version we don't use and can't update to right because complex reason.<p>If you're just taking your requirements and working without having to negotiate with another person, you're probably not doing senior work.<p>Some of it I the site I don't think is senior work really unless you're a tiny shop, but they're not weird since these are all skills a for senior adjacent roles that any senior might be called on to take randomly. It's not uncommon in many shops for leads to be a spontaneous and temporary role for some project that disappears on major release.</p>"},{"id":"71a978170b59102e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by beebmam in \"Why SaaS prices are still going up when companies are spending less\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3095.2784683070035,"y":956.9635509585378,"wires":[["158f5c87eddcad5c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459024\n<hr>\n<p>Terms like SaaS, IaaS, PaaS are pretty fluid outside of specific contexts.</p>"},{"id":"762c730c248c38b3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by eep_social in \"“Make” as a Static Site Generator (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5734.440716826136,"y":3268.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459023\n<hr>\n<p>I agree with everything you wrote — what I was trying to communicate is that there’s no shame in not feeling the urge to share as it happens to be that the vast majority of us, like the gp post, don’t but that’s not easy to see or quantify.<p>Aside, I almost wrote “silent majority” but that seemed like it was veering towards politics so I went with vocal minority; I suspect there is a better term out there but I didn’t find it quickly.</p>"},{"id":"306cc08c64b8baf7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by slt2021 in \"How does Linux NAT a ping?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:17:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3590,"y":320,"wires":[["21500f84a220962"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459022\n<hr>\n<p>NAT stands for Network Address Translation, which means a NAT device maintains a translation table of internal IPs to external, so that it can return response packets coming from Internet to a proper destination on the internal network.<p>By definition NAT will maintain state which is translation table.

Oil and commodities in general are a very hard line of business.

A lot of companies die during this time, usually the small/independent ones..<p>And even when he had Oil Barons like Rockefeller, should they be really considered as evil?

T\nhe idea of using a high frequency rotating transformer or inductive coupler to transmit current to the field winding without using brushes and slip rings has been investigated by a number of companies, universities, and national labs.<p>A good survey paper of excitation systems for wound field synchronous machines or electrically excited synchronous machines is.<p>J.

In state-of-the-art electric vehicles there are basically three main machine topologies that are used for the main traction machine.<p>- Interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs): A large number of OEMs and suppliers use/supply this motor topology, e.g., General motors, Tesla model 3, Ford, etc.<p>- Induction machines (IMs): Also used by a large number of OEMs and suppliers, e.g., Tesla model S and X, G.M. for assist motors, etc.<p>- Wound field synchronous machines (WFSMs) [in Europe more commonly known as electrically excited synchronous machines (EESMs) but they are the same thing] - Currently used in Renault and some BMW models. A large number of suppliers are developing them.<p>Each of the machine topologies has tradeoffs compared to the others, cost, manufacturing CapEx, supply chain risk, drive cycle efficiency, difficulty of control, failure modes, cooling complexity, etc.<p>WFSMs or EESMs have some potential advantages over IPMSMs or IMs for some applications.<p>- They don't contain rare earth permanent magnets eliminating the supply chain and price volatility associated with them.<p>- In terms of drive cycle efficiency generally they are more efficient than IMs and if the drive cycle is dominated by moderate torques and highspeeds they can exceed the drive cycle efficiencies of IPMSMs.<p>- They are very easy to field weaken and theoretically can have an infinite constant power speed range.<p>- The field excitation can be controlled to provide unity power factor potentially allowing the stator inverter to be downsized.<p>The main negatives of WFSMs or EESMs compared to IPMSMs or IMs are:<p>- The field excitation is more complicated and requires power electronics either for brushes and slip rings or inductive power transfer approaches.<p>- The cooling of the field winding is difficult and typically spray/jet cooling of the end turns or at a minimum through shaft cooling.<p>- The control of WFSMs or EESMs is considerably more complicated than IPMSMs or IMs.</p>"},{"id":"aaf3199381c456ab","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Finnucane in \"Viagra Lowers the Risk of Alzheimer’s by Almost 70%, Study Finds\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4188.440716826136,"y":2636.3615977627937,"wires":[["5e3bfba726b1cbf9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459210\n<hr>\n<p>\"IF your ability to remember why you opened the fridge lasts more than 4 hours, call a doctor.\"</p>"},{"id":"39604504bf7adc","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by chiefalchemist in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:39:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1300.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459209\n<hr>\n<p>Trees also \"capture\" heat.

I may switch to the 16\" Gram because it does have touch and stylus... and I won't have to carry the tablet.</p>"},{"id":"c943d411b4a90e11","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by moritz in \"Earth had hottest 3-months on record; unprecedented sea temps & extreme weather\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:37:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:37:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2850.440716826136,"y":2480.3615977627937,"wires":[["2cef94ce36463616"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459199\n<hr>\n<p>funny you should mention that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchants_of_Doubt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchants_of_Doubt</a></p>"},{"id":"d38efec27d58456e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by mupuff1234 in \"A Senior Engineer's Check-List (2019)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:37:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:37:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6242.440716826136,"y":3044.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459198\n<hr>\n<p>The list is exhausting, I just wanna build some stuff.</p>"},{"id":"f4cc83428aff292a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Finnucane in \"The molecule DIM reduces biofilms causing dental plaque: study\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:37:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:37:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8078.440716826136,"y":3940.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459197\n<hr>\n<p>What's more likely, vast cabal conspiring against competing product, or competing product just doesn't work as well as claimed?

For instance a critical component to the conspiratorial view is Operation Northwoods [1]. And it tends to paint a far different than picture than you are claiming. Operation Northwoods was a planned CIA operation where they were going to carry out terrorist attacks against both civilian and military US targets (notably they even proposed the use of remote controlled civilian aircraft) and blame it on Cuba, so we could start a war with them. This plan successfully made its way all the way up the chain of the command and was one signature away from being executed. The problem is that JFK rejected it, vigorously.<p>The CIA and the military wanted global escalation and military conflict. Kennedy, by contrast, was working more towards reconciliation and global peace through good faith. Just prior to Operation Northwoods, he had recently removed the head of the CIA (following the Bay of Pigs catastrophe), and following the Joint Chief of Staffs presentation of Operation Northwoods to him, JFK also removed him from power as well. JFK would then go to on to pass a unilateral nuclear test ban as a show of good faith to the USSR, and was reportedly not only looking to withdraw from Vietnam, but also to completely dismantle the CIA. Less than 6 months later, he would be assassinated.<p>That's hardly a tale of some 'shadowy elite trying to control the world.' In fact it becomes the assassination becomes so utterly predictable in this context that one has to consider that if it was a simple lone-wolf then the CIA and military effectively won some sort of one in a quadrillion type lottery (at least from their rather sociopathic worldviews). For that assassin to then to be assassinated, after initially claiming he was a \"patsy\", and all the other weirdness around it all, I think Occam's Razor starts pointing in a pretty clear direction.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a></p>"},{"id":"710d9566b6dc07e3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ndsipa_pomu in \"Five billion people will face extreme heat at least a month each year by 2050\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:43:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:43:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5294.440716826136,"y":3120.3615977627937,"wires":[["f49f79899e1beaa3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459252\n<hr>\n<p>Are cold weather deaths increasing or predicted to increase significantly?

That's just bullshit to try pushing people against A/C.<p>Cities are hotter than outside because:<p>- they absorb more heat :: concrete, asphalt absorb much more than grass or trees and disperse far more slowly. Just go walking in a bush, measure temperature at 1.5 m from soil, do the same in grass covered area and the same over a road. You'll see and feel the difference;<p>- in cities there are MANY ICE vehicles whose engine produce much heat, much more than any electrical motor;<p>- in cities there is less air circulation than in the open nature due to the high and heat-absorbing buildings;<p>- in many cities glass coated skyscraper works like any other glass keeping much of Sun IR radiation inside.<p>These are the reason why cities are hotter. Another proof? They are ALSO hotter in winter, not just in summer. In winter you can count extra heat from badly insulated heated buildings, little cold pushed outside by the so far limited percentage of people heating with some heat pumps that have air on their exterior side, but look at the numbers and you'll see they are more hotter than mere heats spread outside by badly insulated heated buildings.<p>People should learn two things:<p>- cities WAS a necessity to evolve in the past, but with the '80 logistic revolution they lost one of their last reasons to exists, manufacturing became cheaper to do far from customers, so far from cities. With the remote work the last remaining reasons vanish as well. As a result dense cities and high rise buildings have NO REASONS TO EXISTS anymore. Try to keep them and sell them as green, good for the future etc is just a push toward intensive human farming to keep people dependent on service they don't own, living to operate them so they can pay them. Since in the modern era cities can't be sustained the push needs to makes people accept bad living condition as a new normal;<p>- we need to switch from a high density model, too dense for today state of tech and society, climate etc to a new less dense one, that's hard and that's means MANY will be simply \"overflowing humans\" to be put somewhere, since no one like that role, if told in such a crude way, some try to advertise such role with various \"bells and whistles\" but that's simply BULLSHIT.<p>If you try reasoning about the above you'll understand a thing: such move to put aside a significant percentage of humans can't really work, never worked in history. It does work if the set aside cohort is very limited, the poorest, very isolated and very dependent, but at modern scale can't work.</p>"},{"id":"da030e8df7c0c8d7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by OrsonSmelles in \"I wired up my bike's GPS to order me pizza during a gravel race\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:49:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:49:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1990,"y":1552,"wires":[["bb45ade057f478bf"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459304\n<hr>\n<p>I think I'm slightly more worried that photonicinduction has <i>actually died</i> when he goes silent for a while, though.

Some stuff I’ve seen:<p>- chatbot sales: “see how it recovers here because I misunderstood the question and gave a different answer than expected?”. (Demo was a linear path with this ‘recovery’ hard coded)\n- Buy side: “yes absolutely we already integrate with X”. Queue 12 months of delays because they had never integrated with that platform before.<p>But, I think I get it. The deals are huge and you only sell a few a year. Once an enterprise commits, it is unlikely to switch vendors unless it goes really really bad. So, the salesperson that convincingly lies gets the deal, and surprisingly the downside is relatively limited.<p>OTOH, not massaging the truth might mean losing that deal. Huge downside, very limited upside. (Yes the buyer might be a bit more happy, but that likely doesn’t outweigh sometimes missing a multi million deal, unless buyer talk a lot with each other).</p>"},{"id":"66adcaaddd91ba97","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by fragmede in \"A Case for Simple UDP Load Balancing\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5918.440716826136,"y":1344.3615977627937,"wires":[["89c178ee5578dbb0"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459296\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"1a9e35a4d23f136f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by YeGoblynQueenne in \"Signs of the Zodiac: The Dendera Dating Controversy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5974.440716826136,"y":3940.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459295\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"3e7336436abf9ebc","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by WheatMillington in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:38 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:38 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1500.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459294\n<hr>\n<p>If you're replacing your gas every 2-4 years, something is terribly wrong.</p>"},{"id":"a0161fe88bcf264c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sethbannon in \"Mistakes You Should Never Make (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:48:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5166.440716826136,"y":3324.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459293\n<hr>\n<p>Post author here.

For example, knowing exactly how long the bridge you need to build matters greatly, and the cost of surveying should be pretty low. In contrast, measuring the soil at the site you build on top of has a variety[1] of options with varying costs. You can't ever be 100 percent certain that your sampling was good enough, but the samples more you have the more confident you can be. Depending on the project and design, you may not need the most expensive and most accurate option, but you probably don't want to just rely on priors built through \"experience.\"<p>Translating this to the world of software, we have a variety of data collection strategies. A/B tests, canaries, software instrumentation, tracing, offsite monitoring, f-scores, beta tests, market surveys, and more. The best thing you can do as an engineer making an uninformed choice is to design the system to collect the data you are missing and to make it easy to change your design later. Amazon calls these \"two way doors\" versus \"one way doors\"; if your decision was wrong you can go back and make a different choice. As an example, if you are designing a caching system, spending a bit of time to generalize the API will allow you to swap between policies as you collect data about cache hit rates. If you don't, the cost of changing your mind goes up as more things depend on the nuances of your API.<p>Rather valorize making uninformed decisions, I'd prefer to valorize flexibility and continuous data collection. Seen this way, the old adage \"There's never enough time to do it right, but always plenty of time to do it over\" is a coherent philosophy.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_investigation#Soil_samplers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_investigation#Soi...</a></p>"},{"id":"82eaaef3b37d17d6","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:59:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:59:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1540.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459409\n<hr>\n<p>There were HN threads about this (?)<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27782370\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27782370</a> (<i>\"Passive radiative cooling below ambient airtemperature under direct sun\"</i>)</p>"},{"id":"fbbe88ebde0f565c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by tgv in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:59:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:59:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6014.440716826136,"y":3996.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459408\n<hr>\n<p>So, in the beginning, they play recordings.

Of this, 4.6 million deaths on an average occurred annually due to extreme cold while 0.48 million deaths occurred due to extreme heat.<p>The study is here: <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00081-4/fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5...</a><p>This shows that cold deaths outnumber heat deaths about 10:1, so global warming is a net positive when it comes to avoiding death.<p>Additionally, heat deaths currently happen in countries that lack air conditioning because it was not historically needed. This is rapidly changing. Fortunately, cooling takes less energy than heating, which seems paradoxical at first, but it makes sense if you consider that cooling doesn't need to generate heat, but simply move it away (which also requires energy, but less than raising the temperature of a closed system by the equivalent temperature). Additionally, heat pumps can run on electricity from renewable energy sources, rather than heating which mostly uses fossil fuels (yes, heating can use electricity too, but that's currently an order of magnitude more expensive).<p>All of these factors show that moderate global warming is good for the planet: it reduces overall energy use, it reduces fossil fuel use in particular (which is great because it's fossil fuels that are contributing to the greenhouse effect), and it reduces human death rates. You rarely hear about this, however, because the media is committed to pushing the false narrative that the world is on a path to global destruction.</p>"},{"id":"36ba288bab382a60","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by nly in \"The U.S. housing market vs. the Canadian housing market\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:03:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:03:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5854.440716826136,"y":3828.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459456\n<hr>\n<p>tl;dr your wealth should be measured as \"1 house\" not in dollars.</p>"},{"id":"a9d2fddec69604d7","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by djmips in \"Peredvizhnikov Engine is a fully lock-free game engine written in C++20\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:03:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:03:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6874.440716826136,"y":2788.3615977627937,"wires":[["ecac6b4756c08597"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459455\n<hr>\n<p>\"Unpredictable delays during frame rendering cause jank\"<p>This is usually not serious inflicted and the presentation threads will be higher priority than the simulation in order to minimize visual 'jank'<p>Lockfree game code ain't fixing jank from the OS.</p>"},{"id":"4c6b737046336647","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by gwnywg in \"Ask HN: ISO/SOC2 Certifications\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:03:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:03:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6630.440716826136,"y":2652.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459454\n<hr>\n<p>I have seen ISO 27001 implemented twice, both time it was led by someone who knew the game (each time it was different person).

market-based here, with only spot and day-ahead markets whereas most (all?) other ISOs have year-ahead capacity auctions. the upshot for producers is that peak rates are capped much higher, around $10k here vs around $2k elsewhere. this worked for a while but renewables can sell at near zero most of the time thanks to tax credits. dispatchable producers stay competitive with a poor state of repair and a more selective approach to generation that favors peak hours. this is why in the summer we are constantly getting conservation notices but rarely have wide blackouts, as spikes to $1500+

A <i>lot</i> of CJS modules are built around side-effects during module loading, built on assumptions from the way that Node especially synchronously loads everything, that break in any attempt to make the process asynchronous. It's <i>not</i> just a matter of syntax sugar, it's a trouble of bad assumptions and presumptions in the CJS format itself that browsers have no way to paper over (but bundlers can fake by putting everything in the same file). Loading a new file is always an asynchronous operation in a browser. CJS has never supported that. Those problems were known <i>at the time</i> when Node picked CJS. (AMD was the competing format that worked in browsers. AMD had its own problems and was a pain to work in without tools like Typescript, but <i>it</i> was compatible with browsers. CJS never was. ESM imports <i>are</i> backward compatible with AMD imports but because AMD is mostly a dead format in 2023 no browser today actually implements the shims to support that, but they were on the table for a long time and can still be ponyfilled if anyone is crazy enough to have an AMD codebase in 2023 that didn't switch to a CJS-based hodge podge in Node at some point in the last decade and that they can't all-at-once migrate to ESM. Which in my experience mostly just describes what's left of Esri's over-reliance on Dojo's AMD loader for ArcGIS JS and just about nothing else in the wild in 2023.)

This also creates the problem of a once-great product deteriorating into mediocrity over time which also threatens grip on market share.</p>"},{"id":"c27cb35902df947e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by asimpleusecase in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4946.440716826136,"y":1380.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459561\n<hr>\n<p>This was the killer app for Google glass and all other “smart glasses” -  anyone not want this superpower?</p>"},{"id":"b7210dc3025e2f35","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by fsckboy in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8238.440716826135,"y":4052.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459559\n<hr>\n<p>maybe your memory of being surprised or the one that the details didn't line up is the false memory!</p>"},{"id":"144a6259812fac2e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by bmer in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3295.735805147377,"y":240.20550850678956,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459558\n<hr>\n<p>Okay, so I looked this up on Wikipedia.<p>And I suppose my next questions would be:<p>* \"why were those managing the recount so inflexible about when the re-count had to be completed by?\"<p>* \"why wasn't there any middle ground that could have been achieved by those (ostensibly) asking for 'openness' and those wanting to do the recount?\" --- for example, by this, I am imagining something like the police maintaining order amongst the viewing public, so that they do not physically harm or otherwise distract the re-counting officials, and having professional observers from both parties available to make rounds as the process is being executed?</p>"},{"id":"8d9016ac0854dd39","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by rusk in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:13:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6722.440716826136,"y":3996.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459557\n<hr>\n<p>> Arguably a conspiracy as well but that depends on our definition of \"conspiracy.\"<p>Not a conspiracy in the more surreptitious sense that most people consider.

Is this a terminology thing? I design my own brushless motor controllers. A brushless motor operates by generating a magnetic field in fixed coils and using that magnetic field to directly act on magnets.<p>Wikipedia defines magnetic induction thusly: “Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force (emf) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field.” So basically using a changing magnetic field to create voltage in a conductor. While it is true that induction occurs in a brushless motor as a secondary effect (the rotating rotor induces back EMF on the stator coils), the primary mechanism of movement is a magnetic field physically acting on permanent magnets - no induction involved.<p>This is distinct from an AC induction motor, about which Wikipedia says: “An induction motor or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding.” basically in an induction motor, induction is a required effect for the operation of the motor, rather than a side effect as in a brushless motor.<p>So while induction occurs in a brushless motor, if induction could be magically disabled the motor would still work. This is not true for an induction motor.</p>"},{"id":"48decd5d9467e9d1","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"$400M in assets to bankrupt in 45-minutes because of a failed deployment (2014)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:07:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:07:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2955,"y":1128.5402914245121,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/\">https://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459495\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459495</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>"},{"id":"3397c5f36dd0cf45","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Why Is the Ocean Salty?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:56:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:56:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2857.194349428759,"y":20,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-ocean-salty\">https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-ocean-salty</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459371\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459371</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>"},{"id":"99aa131ded1e223e","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Battery-Electric Fishing Vessel Marks a Sea Change for Small Commercial Fishers","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:48:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 18:48:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5318.440716826136,"y":3764.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2023/battery-electric-fishing-vessel-marks-a-sea-change-for-small-commercial-fishers.html\">https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2023/battery-electric-fishing-vessel-marks-a-sea-change-for-small-commercial-fishers.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458753\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37458753</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"3baf9935db016e04","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by akira2501 in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:24:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:24:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5346.440716826136,"y":4276.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459682\n<hr>\n<p>The problem is,  the Secret Service could see that too,  and Dallas wasn't exactly a \"friendly\" city.

Instead of a single electron-hole pair, SPAD's are reverse biased beyond \"breakdown voltage\" such that the released charge carrier will in turn release others (the \"A\"valanche in SPAD). The breakdown voltage and reverse bias (together with a dark current) means the sensor will heat up. So it would need significant cooling and energy consumption (higher currents per photon at higher breakdown voltage) at normal daytime light intensities. The sheer rate of photons would not allow individual photon pulses to be discriminated as their pulses would overlap... The reason it's not in your phone is because it would be expensive, power hungry (decreasing battery life) and require cooling.</p>"},{"id":"a11e9bdd8ef1285f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by kbrisso in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:33:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:33:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6054.440716826136,"y":4108.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459776\n<hr>\n<p>One of the cable networks had a guy make the shot from the exact same height and distance.

It is a streamlined curved shape which can move very efficiently through the water <i>at slow speeds</i>.   It has a maximum speed, and if you try to push it beyond that, efficiency drops a lot and you put in a lot more energy for small speed increases.<p>A 'planing' hull is normally used on speedboats and the like.  It has two efficient modes - either displacement, or planing (where the boat rises most of the way out of the water and only has a small contact area).  Typically there is a region in between - a speed the boat cannot travel at a fixed throttle - it can go faster or slower though.<p>There are lots of other possible hull designs - but in general you need to pick your ideal speed or range of speeds (and loads, and wave conditions), and optimize for minimum energy consumption at those speeds.<p>In the modern world, you normally combine this with a cost optimization - trading off the salary and depreciation and opportunity cost of travelling slower, with the saved fuel of travelling slower.<p>In an electric boat, where energy storage is <i>really</i> expensive, it is even more important to do a really good job of this optimization - and I forsee we'll see more people attempt esoteric yet theoretically very efficient hulls, like hydrofoils, to try to have a big edge in a market where energy efficiency is suddenly a big driving factor.</p>"},{"id":"59b8028af3364d4a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by rambambram in \"“Make” as a Static Site Generator (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:33:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 20:33:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6870.440716826136,"y":3380.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37459773\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks!<p>Yeah, somewhere between the homepages and webrings of the nineties and the added social functionality of the early social media platforms.
