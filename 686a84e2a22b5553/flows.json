How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6794.440716826136,"y":844.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6302.440716826136,"y":2084.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2200,"y":2990,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

It's common sense. You're human so it's easy to figure out. It's possible that our modern woke culture makes this harder analyze because it's very one sided in terms of gender.<p>Desire for diamonds is centered around women. It's part of human mating rituals.<p>A lot of woman demand sacrifice or some sort of proof that the man loves her and is willing to sacrifice resources to take care of her. Romance is 100 percent what this is. It's always a man putting in a romantic gesture and a woman making a practical decision based on that gesture(s). Society often gets these roles reversed but in actuality: men are the romantic sex, women are the practical sex.<p>One form of this sacrifice comes in the form of material jewelery.  First the sacrifice needs to be a \"sacrifice\" or basically useless in terms of utility. Second it needs to be \"showable\" meaning the woman can use the thing and \"show\" other people that a man sacrificed a huge amount of money just for her.<p>Diamonds fulfill the above request more than anything else. If a woman has a house it's not clear whether the house was a sacrifice just for her or for him as well, but if she has a diamond it is 100 percent clear it was for her and nothing else.<p>So that's where it comes from. Human mating rituals. Diamonds are pleasing to the eye but there plenty of cheap forms of gemstones that are pleasing to the eye. The rarity and mostly zero utility nature of a diamond ring makes it an object ideal for tribute.<p>It is a shame, but you can't deny human nature. Women want tribute from men and they want put that tribute on display to show off their status. Men will as a result fight tooth and nail for the status and the ability to provide a high value woman with that tribute. Entire businesses will spawn and form around this human behavioral quirk and one of these industries is the diamond industry.<p>That's the way the world works.</p>"},{"id":"8f21decb5fd0b663","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by m_mueller in \"Sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky is moving from science fiction to reality\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 13:50:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 13:50:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":117.43559398627008,"y":2430.388462779689,"wires":[["bb79b781ba1924e6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455747\n<hr>\n<p>I never said to do nothing.

There's nothing with being happy with Starbucks.  And yes, Starbucks deserves a lot of credit for promoting an interest in better quality coffee.<p>But a lot of what has attracted Starbucks' huge audience has been their very milky, sweetened, flavoured beverages that end up not being much of a coffee by the time they're consumed, and I think when people scoff at Starbucks, that's a big part of what they're reacting to. I do think people who just have very milky coffee like cafe latte and flat white but then diss Starbucks are mostly just being snobbish.<p>I'm from Melbourne Australia, which several people in this thread have commented about, and I know what people are talking about, both those who talk about the good coffee here and those who talk about the superiority complex we have developed about it. I can see it both ways. Starbucks didn't take off here, not because people thought it was \"bad\"; we just didn't need it, people already had favourite cafes serving coffee they really liked, so there was no need to change.<p>But the modern-day, 3rd-wave coffee snobbery thing arose a few years after that.  On the one hand, like everything Melbourne claims to be better at, it can be a bit eye-rolly. On the other hand, my favourite coffee these days is long macchiato (I developed the taste for it when spending time in Italy and marrying into an Italian-Australian family), and even in Melbourne it can be hit-and-miss finding a cafe that does a long-mac \"right\"; I don't mean to be snobby about it, it's just about how I like it having developed a taste for it over several years.</p>"},{"id":"23199ca54ce7e383","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by badtension in \"Earth had hottest 3-months on record; unprecedented sea temps & extreme weather\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 13:54:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 13:54:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2840.440716826136,"y":1820.3615977627937,"wires":[["2cef94ce36463616"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455774\n<hr>\n<p>> It was the hottest August on record – by a large margin – and the second hottest ever month after July 2023, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service ERA 5 dataset.

I have been using my Macbook for some AI work I'm doing, but my workflow has been a mess.

My Linux box operates under 1% CPU load all the time.  My point is not to say my setup is better (I'm not an evangelist on these things), but that I found a huge productivity boost for my needs with a minimal setup.

The reason that companies make products is to sell them yes. But the reason the products are made in polluting ways and with essentially unrecylable materials is cost cutting. Regulate industries to use the more expensive but less impactful production methods, and you find that pollution will actually go down in a way that matters. Tell individuals to stop buying plastic bottles and you'll get a subset of the middle to upper class to somewhat comply. Make plastic bottles illegal (or at least mandate that the company buy them back to really recycle) and the problem becomes moot, it's not like individuals can make plastic.
