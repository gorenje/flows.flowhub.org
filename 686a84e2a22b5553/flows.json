It used to be that you would launch it and it was as highly-responsive as most native Windows apps of that era.<p>I'm backing to using it at my new job (Office 365 subscription with all the desktop apps), and it's literally unusable for several minutes at startup. The UI just stops responding while it presumably does some background sync. I can't even click a button and start writing an email. Confirmed on two different computers.<p>This is the sort of characteristic I'd expect from a junior dev writing an Electron app in his spare time. I don't expect it from one of the three flagship apps of Microsoft Office.<p>My current flow has become launching Outlook to send an email, then realizing what's going to happen, open Notepad++ to write my emails in, then when Outlook finally becomes responsive again after a few minutes, I copy-paste them in it. Every time I do this, I think less of Microsoft.<p>When did this change happen?

There will be lots of disappointment, and the hype will die down.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c5090ba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c509...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/20/uk-global-race-produce-ai-chips\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/20/uk-global-r...</a></p>"},{"id":"7a0093870b503eca","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by NovemberWhiskey in \"HDMI ISA graphics card for vintage PCs by improving the Graphics Gremlin\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2160,"y":2832,"wires":[["3f30c40143df84bc"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468589\n<hr>\n<p>If you only want to drive the monitor in DVI compatibility mode, you don't need very much because the interface is (as you describe) fairly simple and electrically compatible - if you actually want \"real\" HDMI then it's much more complex.</p>"},{"id":"c3464052a5719860","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by jimmytucson in \"Altering Python attribute handling for modules\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1740,"y":1300,"wires":[["bcabfb8a019ca6cd"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468588\n<hr>\n<p>There are more inexperienced users than experienced ones, so if it really does disproportionately affect inexperienced users, it’s an even bigger problem!</p>"},{"id":"3daea8b39750b0a4","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by airocker in \"Nvidia’s AI supremacy is only temporary\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5910,"y":1948,"wires":[["9033fc872cd70470"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468587\n<hr>\n<p>Inference will not work on cpu, I see 100 percent cpu frequently when doing cpu inference and we had to change to use GPUs for a large client.</p>"},{"id":"b1a5619b04078eb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by caydenpiercehax in \"Convoscope: Smart Glasses Intelligence Tools\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:19:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2829.269325438125,"y":1095.2365363749418,"wires":[["274b3c6ea7228562"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468586\n<hr>\n<p>Proactive AI is the killer app for Smart Glasses.

Being better technically and having better software is not enough long term for ridiculous profits, unless you have an extreme lock in. And in Nvidia's case, it is not even as if there is a wide variety of external software that has to run on any alternative. Most companies just need to run <5 ML frameworks and moving that inference to something cheaper doesn't sound too hard, and in any case puts a ceiling on what Nvidia can charge. Training will be harder, but at some level of expenditure threshold crossing, there will be enough money pumped into it by atleast the big clouds to put a ceiling on Nvidia margins there too.<p>The comparisons with Nvidia's long term GPU dominance are misguided.

Tobacco companies, for example, definitely used cutting-edge (for its era) agro-tech to increase yields, potency, etc since like the 1950s and earlier. Tech has been a tool for developing weapons, addictive substances, and useless consumer goods since the industrial revolution (at least). The history of technology is chock-full of abominations. For every \"refrigerator\" there's \"holes in the ozone layer\", for every \"golden rice\" there's \"Agent Orange\".<p>I 100% agree that modern consumer society is absolutely out of control, and that tech is a major driver, but I see this as an intensification of trends that have been in place for centuries rather than a paradigm shift from a previously benign era. As much as I love the various cultural trappings of 90s tech-optimism (and I do love many things about that era) I think it was ultimately kind of a delusion brought on by the complete global dominance of the US economic model (following the end of the Cold War), alongside the headiness of the dot-com bubble, rather than a clear-sighted vision for the future of \"technology\" (wherever you draw the line on what that is). Not trying to shame anyone who participated in that scene, or say that it was \"bad\" or \"wrong\", but I do think that we can't really afford to be sentimental these days.

Companies which want to enrich e.g. search with AI but don't need full \"chat\" capabilities are already looking for alternatives which are cheaper to run even if a bit worse in capabilities (ignoring training cost).<p>- For the same reason specialized hardware for inference has been a thing for quite a while and is currently becoming more mainstream. E.g. google cloud edge TPUs are for mainly inference, so are many phones AI/Neural cores. I also wouldn't be surprised if the main focus for e.g. the recent AI cores in AMD graphic cards would be inference through you can use them for more then that.<p>- Both AMD and Intel might be less behind then it seems when it comes to training and especially inference. E.g. AMD has been selling somewhat successful GPU compute, just not to the general public. With OpenCL being semi abandoned this lead to them having close to no public mind share. Through with ROCm slowly moving to public availability and AI training being more consolidated on the internal architectures it uses this might change very well. Sure for research, especially of unusual AI architectures, Nvidea will probably still win for a long time. But for \"daily\" LLM training they probably soon will have serious competition, even more so for inference. Similar Intels new dedicated GPU architectures was made with AI training and inference in mind, so at least for inference I'm pretty sure they soon will be competitive, too.<p>- AI training has also become increasingly more professional, with increasingly more often a small number of quite high level frameworks being used. That means that instead of having to make every project work well with your GPU you now can focus on a few high level frameworks. Similar AI architectures widely used differ less extrema then in the past and have less often big changes. Putting both together it means it's today much easier to create hardware+driver which works for well most cases. Which can be good enough to compete.<p>Even with all that said Nvidea has massive mind share which will give them a huge boost and when it comes to bleeding edge/exotic AI research (not just the next generation of LLMs) they probably still will win out hugely. But LLMs is where the current money is, and as far as it seems generational improvements do not come with any massive conceptually architectural changes, but just better composition of the same (by now kinda old) building blocks.</p>"},{"id":"5be6ff61a0e698ac","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by V__ in \"Humans didn't change the climate in the past 365 days, but that volcano did\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:38:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:38:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":9108,"y":3728,"wires":[["9e47faa530768eaf"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37468883\n<hr>\n<p>> this one volcano produced a warming effect on the planet equal to about 5.2 years worth of total global carbon emissions in one go, and it’s going to be stuck up there for over half a decade.<p>> If you believe that CO2 is slowly warming the planet, then the net result of this one very unusual volcano will be to fast forward global warming five years, and keep us at that fast-forward location for between five and ten years, and then will slowly abate.

And maybe a Rx amplifier, especially if we are talking low bit depth. Other elements in the analog path of ham gear might be filters; I don't know what radios tend to have builtin versus what games tend to add themselves here, but that seems like another factor.<p>I bought & have barely used a pretty fancy LimeSDR USB device a long time ago (~$300 then, wish they still made it!). I keep meaning to come back & even finally bought a range of antennas for it. I look at stuff like the $1300 LimeRFE front end, & radio products like this submission & wonder what analog stuff is missing, wonder what else a good ham-grade SDR might have that the dongles & higher end SDR might not have. I like the idea of going software based a lot, it seems appealing, but I think I'm missing an understanding of what hardware is important, is still super good to have.</p>"},{"id":"33544d8a765065bb","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by MichaelDickens in \"X sues Calif. to avoid revealing how it makes “controversial” content decisions\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:54:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 15:54:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":820,"y":3660,"wires":[["6c34608f1fa1d8a8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469135\n<hr>\n<p>In theory, where people are perfect reasoners, it doesn't.

I find setting up Nginx with an ACME tool very involved and painful. Inspired by Caddy's automatic HTTPS, I created something similar for Nginx. It mainly addresses the followings:<p>1. Nginx cannot have HTTPS configuration before the certificates are obtained. So you need to edit the configuration at least once, and also manually reload it after that.<p>2. Nginx and the ACME tool needs to agree on the location to read and write  ACME challenge answers. It can be error-prone.<p>3. Cron jobs have be set up to periodically renew the certificates and Nginx needs to be reloaded after that.<p>4. With the above drawbacks, provisioning an HTTPS web server in an automatic way is quite challenging.<p>With ACME Hugger, you sprinkle the Nginx configuration with a few ACME directives, and it will process the configuration, talk to an ACME server and run Nginx with a derived configuration, to handle all of the above automatically.<p>I hope others can find it useful too.

TensorFlow, PyTorch etc. was what they where using.<p>This means since 5+ years CUDA, DDN and similar where _hidden implementation details_.<p>Which means outside of mindshare Nvidea is surprising simple to replace as long as anyone produces competitive hardware. At least for LLM-style AI usage. But LLMs are dominating the market.<p>And if you look beyond consumer GPUs both AMD and Intel aren't really that far behind as it might look if you only look at consumer GPUs suitability for AI training.<p>And when it comes to inference thinks look even less favorable for Nvidea, because competitive products in that area already exist since quite a while (just not widely consumer available).<p>> the low-cost leader<p>At least for inference Nvidea isn't in that position at all IMHO. A lot of inference hardware comes bundled with other hardware and local inference does matter.<p>So inference hardware bundled with phone, laptop but also IoT chips (e.g. your TV) will matter a lot. But there Nvidea has mainly marked share in the highest end price segment and the network effect of \"comes bundles with\" matters a lot.<p>Same applies to some degree to server hardware. If all you servers run intel CPUs and now you can add intel AI inferrence cards or CPUs with inference components integrated (even lower latency) and you can buy them in bundles, why should you not do so? Same for AMD, same for ARM, not at all the same for Nvidea.<p>And during a time where training and research dominates it's quite likely to push inference cards to be from the same vendor then training cards. But the moment inference dominates the effect can go the other way and like mentioned for a lot of companies weather it used Nvidea or AMD internal can easily become irrelevant in the near future.<p>I.e. I'm expecting the marked to likely become quite competitive, with _risk_ for Nvidea, but also huge chances for them.<p>One especially big risk is the tensions LLMs put on the current marked model of Nvidea which is something like \"sell high end GPUs which are grate for games and  training allowing both marked to subvention each other and create an easy (consumer/small company) availability for training so that when people (and companies) start out with AI they likely will use Nvidea and then stick to it as they can somewhat fluently upscale\". But LLMs are currently becoming so large that they brake that as GPUs for training for them need to be too big to still make sense as high end consumer GPUs. If this trend continuous we might end up in a situation where Nvidea GPUs are only usable for \"playing around\", \"small experiments\" when it comes to LLM training with a friction step when it comes to proper training. But with recent changes with AMD they can very well fill in the \"playing around\", \"small experiments\" in a way which doesn't add additional friction as users anyway use more high level abstractions.</p>"},{"id":"9debcff05f8fb654","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by v8xi in \"Webb Discovers Methane, Carbon Dioxide in Atmosphere of K2-18B\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:04:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:04:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6486,"y":3604,"wires":[["4d7f351195104adb"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469290\n<hr>\n<p>In Nick Lane's Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World, he talks about the importance of both methane and carbon dioxide and how they exist at the extremes of a complex metabolic oxidation-reduction cycle.

[1]  This essay’s bold claims about nvidia are like jetpac: something shortsighted, flashy, and designed to make Pete money.<p>Several flags in the essay:<p>“Machine learning is focused on training, not inference”  Nope!  There are many start-ups that do large-scale inference in the cloud, and have been long before Transformers existed.  Some of said companies are customers of e.g. Roboflow and Determined.ai etc.  Sure it’s not Google-scale, as Pete has been in Tensorflow land for the past few years.<p>“Researchers have the Purchasing Power.”  False!  Some can afford a 2-GPU machine, but Pete’s employer and many other large companies have shifted the attention of researchers to problems that require large clusters.  It’s almost impossible to publish now (e.g. reproduce results and do something new) without Google’s network (hardware money and people) having a hand in it.<p>The rest of the essay outlines a thesis that an inference-focused product (where Pete invests himself) will disrupt nvidia.  Investors take note! Googler is almost done with his handcuffs!<p>There are many risks to nvidia’s moat (they failed to get Arm after all) but this piece is about Pete trying to find investors, not about Nvidia.<p>[1] e.g. <a href=\"https://petewarden.com/2018/05/28/why-you-need-to-improve-your-training-data-and-how-to-do-it/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://petewarden.com/2018/05/28/why-you-need-to-improve-yo...</a>   Among others</p>"},{"id":"e53450878bbf585c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by ksec in \"Nvidia’s AI supremacy is only temporary\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:15:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:15:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5910,"y":2428,"wires":[["9033fc872cd70470"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469458\n<hr>\n<p>Agree, But may be in the author's defence his conclusion is actually somewhat different to the title.<p>>If you believe my four predictions above, then it’s hard to escape the conclusion that Nvidia’s share of the overall AI market is going to drop.

Of course their margin will fall. That is like saying certain product margin will fall after COVID. Yes. because people wont be crazy about it.

wanting to use online format parsers to quickly decode that production JWT or decode a base64 Authorization header but cannot trust these websites to not leak my information. I thought to myself if only I could cut-off network access to this site, use it offline, and then throw away all browsing data. So I created an extension just for that.<p>It uses Firefox contextual identities API (Containers) to isolate browsing data and inter-tab communication. Once the site is fully loaded, I then inject bogus proxy settings for any requests leaving that container to effectively cut-off network access. And once I'm done, I simply delete the Container.<p>Use Cases:<p>* Parse a live JWT token<p>* Convert a Base64 Authorization header<p>* Hash a password<p>* Parse a Protobuf message<p>* Submit my name and birthdate to estimate my date of death<p>Check out the MIT source code on GitHub [1] and install QuaranTab from the Firefox store [2]. If anyone is interested in a discussion, I'd love to chat about:<p>1. Any ideas on how we could implement this in Chromium? Using private window as a \"Container\"?<p>2. Can you come up with an exploit? I posted a 100usd bug bounty [3] if you find one!<p>3. Is there any way to prove an extension in the store was built from source in GitHub?

Their business has gone downhill significantly in the past 5 years or so.<p>The MFA is a joke. I recovered a client's MFA myself with almost no effort. It worked out since didn't properly set up MFA anyway and needed to get it unlocked and set up correctly, but I was shocked how easy it was to pretend to be someone with them. They disabled someone else's MFA with only me confirming a DNS record (which i looked up publicly using dig), plus the name and password of the account. It was scary easy.<p>At one point many years back they decided to stop supporting Authy as their MFA provider and tried to move everyone to their namecheap app, which would be used as a second factor. But the app was so terribly broken and I got locked out of my account multiple times because the app would crash on newer iPhones for a while, so I couldn't access my account. This must have been super common because they disabled MFA for me by just confirming a code sent to my phone. I assume this was a widespread problem and they might have eased up MFA deactivation rules for a time since there were probably a lot of people locked out of accounts.<p>Luckily now, they use mainstream 2FA codes, so you can use any app you want. But the process has already scarred me.<p>Overall, Namecheap has deteriorated to all the problems that Godaddy orginally had. The bait-and-switch renewal prices, clunky UI, slower nameservers, and upsells upsells everywhere for email hosting and everything else.<p>So after about 15 years of namecheap, I will be finding a new home sometime this year for all my domains.</p>"},{"id":"5a4c28ec4bb9e05e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by 0xffff2 in \"Deep dive into the UK air traffic control meltdown\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:20:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:20:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4027.1794164608123,"y":2325.1802242681333,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469532\n<hr>\n<p>Broadly speaking I think this is done for new systems.

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"}]
