It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5234.440716826136,"y":460.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2918.440716826136,"y":2324.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1782.440716826136,"y":3092.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

(For example it is also illegal to hike or camp off-trail.)<p>This is only tenable if there are a large amount of public bathrooms available, otherwise tourists would just ignore the law. So Iceland has a disproportionate amount of bathrooms for conservation reasons.<p>It is even more misleading because many of these bathrooms driving around cost a small fee (200ISK) to use even though they are “public”, I.e. owned by the government and available to everyone.

Derivatives are useful when they stay constant over a stretch of time; when derivatives vary too much, it becomes more efficient to use more points of lower degree. This is the same calculation in other domains of approximation: numerical integration, DiffEq, and Taylor series.<p>For example, to draw rough surfaces, point-to-point lines are the most efficient way, with a ton of points. For industrial geometric shapes, lines and ellipses become efficient. As the smoothness of the curve goes up, more derivatives become valid. But sometimes those higher derivatives are not useful.<p>This is why the parent comment likes the Pencil tool; it's optimal for high variation, because it is a local (smoothed) control of position, the zeroth derivative. The cost is some loss of smoothness, which likely doesn't matter for her domain, since her hands move smoothly enough.<p>I think the Pen tool would be a more competitive alternative with a better control scheme. For example, a Pen tool with local control would unify the Pencil and Pen: letting you draw jagged curves by holding your mouse down, and letting you draw straight lines and smooth curves by clicking. There would be no interruption of flow, as you can use either method freely to continue a curve. They should inherently be the same tool anyway, just with different numbers of derivatives.</p>"},{"id":"aab208635a48eb99","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by pierat in \"Signs of the Zodiac: The Dendera Dating Controversy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:25:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:25:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6018.440716826136,"y":3588.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461109\n<hr>\n<p>Btw, Jews are not the problem.

They'd mainly be at LAN-parties to collect tools and meet other coders. Sometimes they'd show some cool demos they worked on, or some game they were working on<p>- Shared folders of music, films, and pictures would get copied an masse. A LOT of the pictures were definitely <i>not</i> for the public eye.<p>- Some LAN-parties would drag on for weeks, and kind of just become LAN-clubs. People would practically live there...I remember a friend hosted one of the last LAN-parties right around the time World of Warcraft got released, and while it was meant to just last for a weekend, 5-6 guys ended up staying there for a solid month, gaming WoW since the host had high-speed internet. Owner didn't mind, as he was equally hooked on the game.<p>- The older games would only play Age of Empires, and not much else. The competitive gamers would grind StarCraft, and later on CS.<p>- Playing all the pre 1.6 CS versions was a fun time. They seemed to change quite a bit between each update, until 1.6 became the standard.<p>- If we encountered some networking problems, someone always knew a 40-year old networking dude that would gladly show up and fix whatever was needed. Same dudes would always have tons of spare parts lying around.<p>- Right around the time CS 1.6 became popular, we started seeing the first \"pro\" gaming e-sports teams. Back then, these teams would just play at LAN parties, and then go compete in larger regional LAN parties. The prizes were laughable compared to the modern ones...one clan I knew won like $5000, which was split on 5-6 members? Those guys decided to drop out of school and pursue CS full-time, which lasted around 6 months or so.<p>- We would have a national LAN party in Hamar (The Gathering), and traveling there from all the way north was a real bitch. Imagine bringing a full-tower case and 19\" CRT onboard the plane. Even though the first flat-screens sucked, it was infinitely easier/more practical than those CRT screens.<p>And lots of other things.</p>"},{"id":"76d27da8dbfa37a","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by aydyn in \"Lab-grown Meat is not a Climate Change Solution\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:33:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 23:33:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5898.440716826136,"y":3476.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461144\n<hr>\n<p>> Veganism is about not using animal products.

Or, if we’re talking about a broader planned conspiracy, use a blunter instrument like an IED or another vehicle, or both. Why opt for a sniper at all?

As a result, 99% of the calcium added to the cytosol of a cardiomyocyte during each cardiac cycle becomes bound to calcium buffers, creating a relatively small change in free calcium.[2]</p>"},{"id":"2836c805b635d4ed","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by mellosouls in \"The New Clubhouse\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2793,"y":3490,"wires":[["abd0e5c3e3cc7f16"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461330\n<hr>\n<p>Clubhouse was never cool.</p>"},{"id":"718a1a2f1bfbc734","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by Legend2440 in \"Improving NeRF quality by progressive camera placement\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:06:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5758.440716826136,"y":2204.3615977627937,"wires":[["63e39a55b1a18a8f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461329\n<hr>\n<p>Most techniques for nerfs also work for the newer variants like guassian splatting.<p>It's the same fundamental process - optimizing a 3D representation of a scene using gradient descent.

There are some areas of code people are more careful around, but largely we make safety a product of our tools and processes and not some heroic “try harder not to screw up” attitude.<p>I find the impact of helping so many developers and their companies rewarding.</p>"},{"id":"3148f8353208b32f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by grotorea in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:11:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:11:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2510.440716826136,"y":4204.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461359\n<hr>\n<p>Would he be expected to know we would spend decades doing ballistic studies on that bullet trajectory in the heat of the moment?</p>"},{"id":"572661a9cfeeacad","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by robswc in \"Terminal themed website, opinion on design?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:10:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:10:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2674.440716826136,"y":1492.3615977627937,"wires":[["6d893995385a9138"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461358\n<hr>\n<p>Looks good!<p>These are just my opinions;<p>Maybe have the black background be off-black, and the green a tad less sharp, just for easier readability<p>If page times could be loaded in a bit faster, just to make it feel a bit snappier.<p>I love it though, always a fan of \"fun\" design!</p>"},{"id":"a60b7d24d677f769","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by patrick451 in \"Julia and Mojo Mandelbrot Benchmark\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:10:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:10:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5718.440716826136,"y":3252.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461357\n<hr>\n<p>The recommended solution to slow startup times has always been keep a repl open. That's basically the same workflow as a notebook in my mind. Like I said this means there is a large class of tasks julia a doesn't make sense for because paying the startup cost is too expensive compared to python or go.<p>I just timed vscode with the lsp. From the point I open a 40 line file of the lorenz attractor example, it takes 45 seconds until navigation within that same file works, and the lsp hogs 1 GB of memory. That's 5x the memory of clangd and 20x worse performance; hardly what I would consider a snappy experience.<p>I have no doubt that julia can be shoe-horned into realtime applications. But when I read threads like this [1], it's pretty clear that doing so amounts to a hack (e.g., people recommending that you somehow call all your functions to get them jited before the main loop actually starts). Even the mitigations you propose, i.e., pre-allocating everything, don't exploit any guarantees made by the language, so you're basically in cross-your-fingers and pray territory.

I tried to understand what's actually going on. From the actual rule in the Federal Register (<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/30/2020-23765/energy-conservation-program-establishment-of-a-new-product-class-for-residential-dishwashers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/30/2020-23...</a>):<p>> Moreover, the current standard requires standard residential dishwashers to not exceed 307 kWh/year and 5.0 gallons per cycle for the “Normal” cycle. 10 CFR 430.32(f)(1)(i). Consistent with the results of the Department's evaluation of dishwashers offering a 60 to 90 minute “Quick” cycle, DOE's has identified an innovative opportunity for the further development of a dishwasher model offering a “Normal” cycle of one hour or less.<p>I <i>think</i> the issue is that manufacturers struggle to get good cleaning performance subject to the 307 kWh/year, 5 gallon per cycle rule unless the cycle is very slow, and the DOE has indicated that it will allow more water and/or more energy usage for faster dishwashers.<p>(Speaking of water usage, I find it odd that dishwashers don't seem to do a final spray with fresh (non-recirculated) water.  I would gladly use an extra 1/4 - 1/2 gallon per load to get a freshwater rinse at the end.<p>P.S. What's up with kWh/year anyway?  Surely it should be kWh per <i>cycle</i> with an added restriction on additional power used when not running.</p>"},{"id":"bd74248a08a6e86c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by peteradio in \"Small prey compelled prehistoric humans to produce appropriate hunting weapons\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:21:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:21:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7304.440716826136,"y":3316.3615977627937,"wires":[["89882ec70a33202a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461423\n<hr>\n<p>It's hard to understand how such a small population could have managed such an outsized ecological impact when we are several orders of magnitude more populace now.</p>"},{"id":"307acac54ee47c9f","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by brundolf in \"Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale (2014)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2918.440716826136,"y":3420.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461421\n<hr>\n<p>Much as I love articles that reinforce my existing beliefs, high-frequency trading is a pretty extreme case when it comes to how how badly things can go in a short time</p>"},{"id":"232b488122406937","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by BurningFrog in \"Is air conditioning making cities hotter?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:20:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3102.440716826136,"y":1420.3615977627937,"wires":[["83f886866f62e162"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461420\n<hr>\n<p>Trees can shade one story houses, but hardly any multiple floor apartment buildings.<p>Which makes it a good solution only to <i>suburban</i> heating.</p>"},{"id":"ffaab77fa09cfe86","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by MichaelZuo in \"Why Socialism?

It seems very likely that manufacturing existing EV models will be pretty easily convertible to use whatever new battery technology shows up on the market (changing out the skateboard perhaps - not nothing to change but not that hard). Toyota says they have it figured out but their new EVs aren't coming until 2028 model year (5 years!). But this kind of longer timeline also hides the failure of a lot of car makers to invest enough in the battery supply chain - they can't buy enough batteries or they are too expensive, so it's another excuse for what they want anyway, which is not to make that many EVs. They want to keep selling ICE cars while they can.<p>Look at GM and Ford, the GM ultium battery pack has unspecified problems with mass manufacturing, Ford has also slowed down manufacturing at times this cal year (to improve efficiency or something, specific reasons unclear).

And I do mean warming, because people who wash dishes by hand don't make the water nearly as hot as what dishwashers use.</p>"},{"id":"92626bd4739c2777","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by another_story in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:30:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:30:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3318.440716826136,"y":4484.361597762794,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461477\n<hr>\n<p>The silence could have come from embarrassment at later recognition of what he'd done.</p>"},{"id":"a8559d8a33663b32","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by andsoitis in \"Small prey compelled prehistoric humans to produce appropriate hunting weapons\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:30:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:30:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7304.440716826136,"y":3476.3615977627937,"wires":[["89882ec70a33202a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461476\n<hr>\n<p>> But one may well ask: Why did humans become smarter all of a sudden?

The world of <i>enterprise</i> SaaS follows a different business model that I refer to as «hiding the dead horse in the cloud» and holding the customer to ransom.<p>The premise: the customer is already locked into the wares the vendor supplies, and the customer can't easily migrate away from the product. Oftentimes, the product is also ridden with the technical debt, but it either has a feature critical to the business or there are multiple business (and technical) processes that have a deeply ingrained reliance on the product. It is either the data or the integration with the product. Regularly both.<p>The vendor repackages the product («the dead horse») as a SaaS, rolls it out into the cloud (the act of hiding the said dead horse), bumps prices up and slips the bill under the customer's front door (the ransom). Cloud costs are passed onto the customer at a markup. The product (and sometimes the customer) might get minor tangible benefits from the repackaged version, e.g. improved availability and reliability, although even that is not always the case. SaaS products typically do not use native cloud services, they run on EC2 instances (or their equivalent in Azure, less often GCP) and are cobbled together just enough to make them not fall apart.<p>SaaS, as a business model, is not about the engineering excellence most of the time. It is about squeezing the last drop of blood that there is left in a legacy product, now being offered as a shiny-shiny SaaS version («hey, lookie, we are also int the cloud!»). This is the reality.<p>The theory is somewhat different. In between 2000s and 2020 (approximately), vendors used to tailor their products to specific needs of each specific customer which increasingly became difficult to maintain, update and upgrade as there would be no single product titled «ABC», there would a «ABC customised/hand-rolled for customer 123», «ABC customised/hand-rolled for customer 456» and so forth. So the original premise of SaaS was to have a single version of the product for ALL customers that exposes simple data centric and whatever other technical interfaces that the customer would hook into. The enterprise world does not work that way, though.<p>There are positive exceptions in the world of SaaS, and almost all of them are in the startup universe and outside the enterprise.</p>"},{"id":"fdfb5fecf4c75cd3","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by thsksbd in \"ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:28:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:28:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5250.440716826136,"y":2140.3615977627937,"wires":[["7b31306c6b190334"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461465\n<hr>\n<p>You extraoolated a lot about myself from an explanation of what constitutes a machine's personality.<p>For starteds, I wouldn't call the Golf cheap.

When my FitBit seemingly got hit with a bug that killed it, (worked fine one day, then suddenly battery only lasted an hour after just over a year of owning it), I desperately looked for an alternative and ended up stuck getting the cheapest FitBit.
