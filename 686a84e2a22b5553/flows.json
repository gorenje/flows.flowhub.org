We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"https://meticulous.ai/\">https://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463864</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"fe8474f94b1000ed","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Gen Z is giving up on college","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:35:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:35:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4742,"y":780,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/gen-z-is-giving-up-on-college/\">https://www.businessinsider.nl/gen-z-is-giving-up-on-college/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463676\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463676</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 45</p>"},{"id":"3f30c40143df84bc","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"HDMI ISA graphics card for vintage PCs by improving the Graphics Gremlin","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:38:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:38:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2674,"y":2824,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://yeokhengmeng.com/2023/09/hdmi-isa-graphics-card-for-vintage-pcs/\">https://yeokhengmeng.com/2023/09/hdmi-isa-graphics-card-for-vintage-pcs/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"daffe722b507cce3","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"How could the early Unix OS comprise so few lines of code?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:14:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:14:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1992,"y":2640,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/26083/how-could-early-unix-os-comprise-so-few-lines-of-code\">https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/26083/how-could-early-unix-os-comprise-so-few-lines-of-code</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5e7163dfc732abcd","type":"subflow:1953702d0e9e0265","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"To make dishwashers great again?

Older white college graduates, those born before 1980, were, as you might expect, a lot wealthier than their white peers who had only a high school degree. On average, they had accumulated two or three times as much wealth as high school grads of the same race and generation. But younger white college graduates — those born in the 1980s — had only a bit more wealth than white high school graduates born in the same decade, and that small advantage was projected to remain small throughout their lives.<p>The data for Black families showed the same pattern, but with an even more pronounced downturn. As with the white graduates, older Black college grads were enjoying sizable wealth advantages over their less-educated peers, with generally two or three times the assets of comparable Black high school grads. But Black college graduates born after 1980 were experiencing almost no wealth premium at all. In fact, the researchers found that the wealth premium for Black grads disappeared even earlier than it did for the white graduates. Black college graduates born in the 1970s weren’t receiving any substantial wealth benefit, either, only those born in the 1960s and earlier. Latino families followed a similar pattern. If they were headed by someone born after 1980, they had accumulated no significant additional resources beyond those of a comparable family headed by a high school graduate.<p>\"\"\"<p>From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/magazine/college-worth-price.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/magazine/college-worth-pr...</a> - source paper is at <a href=\"https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2019/10/15/is-college-still-worth-it-the-new-calculus-of-falling-returns.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/revie...</a><p>It make sense, I suppose, that in an efficient market the cost of college would rise to capture the return.</p>"},{"id":"cbae264e21c43a3d","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by johnnyanmac in \"The end of the subscription era is coming\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:45:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:45:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2674,"y":2992,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464179\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"c7f660d61905a527","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by mcv in \"Why is the ocean salty?

You can get started for free and if you never want to spend anything it’s possible to grind the resources you need to acquire new cards and compete in tournaments. You can get all the way to money prizes this way. Constructed formats are probably more economical than draft because you don’t have to constantly pay for packs.<p>In real life, every player has thousands of cards they’d happily dump on you if you just want to learn and have fun. You won’t be able to build a very competitive deck (or one up to date with current formats) but it’s fun to play over the table with friends.<p>The best investment for physical cards is probably the Commander format. This is a particularly social, multiplayer format, where all cards are legal (except for powerful stuff that’s been banned). You can build a deck over years and it’ll always be valid (if not good). This is also available on Arena, but most of the fun is getting round a table.<p>If you want to get competitive, there’s lots of content out there and many popular streamers to learn from. Magic Online is probably where the highest skilled players still play and test for tournaments but you’re unlikely to go infinite there.</p>"},{"id":"eb530c50714f0cd","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by bni in \"New JFK assassination revelation could upend the lone gunman theory\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:44:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:44:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2674,"y":3552,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464173\n<hr>\n<p>The production value in this one is amazing</p>"},{"id":"978bfd0129b3f193","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by t0suj4 in \"The Decline of Usability (2020)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:44:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:44:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5940.440716826136,"y":452.36159776279374,"wires":[["ba2e848a285a820f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464172\n<hr>\n<p>Almost every company internally works as command economy.

That way we can track the other frames that other clients have completed from the input they send and slow or speed ourselves up to maintain a decent margin.

There's some rose tinted glasses here. This was the era in which app theming was a huge fad. Relatively few companies attempted to create consistent and usability tested approaches to their UI, and when they did, it was always operating system companies that were writing their own UI toolkits and lots of little bundled applets. They wanted these to be consistent, and they wanted to understand how to make things like file or hardware management easy.<p>This then dovetailed with some other trends: the software industry was moving to GUIs very fast, competitive advantage often came from how quickly you could release a Windows port back then, and the industry was relatively poor. Many big name software firms were like 20 devs and a few admin assistant types at most. So they all used the built-in APIs because that was the only way to actually get a decent GUI to market fast enough, and it outsourced all the thinking and design leadership to successful companies. If you tried to reinvent all that stuff, not only would you arrive late to the GUI party but your app would probably not fit on floppy disks anymore.<p>Towards the end of the 90s the internet started getting good, but OS makers were also getting fat and lazy. They dropped the ball on internet distribution and connectivity, then dropped it on managed code as well. People started writing these new fangled \"DHTML Web Apps\" along with Java applets to obtain a solution, and also perhaps one day to escape from the Microsoft hegemony. But the web was extremely under-designed. It barely had GUI widgets at all, let alone the large usability tested sets of UX conventions that Windows and macOS had. Java had those widgets but it came from a server company that was just aping whatever the desktop companies had done, they didn't really \"get\" it and their tech back then wasn't good enough to make it fly. For a while people tried to emulate desktop widgets in JS and DHTML but the results always felt second class.<p>But the combination of easy distribution, a mainframe style app model, open standards and free-beer end user clients was more valuable to people than the classical Windows/Mac OS offering. Not to everyone by any means, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth as developers started abandoning native apps. But distribution dominates everything and OS vendors didn't respond, so, we got the web.<p>With the web most of the old Xerox PARC desktop idioms died due to lack of proper browser support.
