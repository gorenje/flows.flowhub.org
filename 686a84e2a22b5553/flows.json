the Bay Area in a few years, probably around when I’m 38. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young but things happened and life got in the way.<p>But I’ve seen so many people online saying things like “I wouldn’t live there”, “it’s good when you’re young”, “the goal is to leave”. How true are these statements?<p>I have been working for companies out of the bay remotely since 2020, and really want to get back to an office. And I want to be where it all happens. I finally got the green light from my wife and if we sold our house here, we’d make enough for a down payment of about 300-400k.

based on a defined set of criteria that many can be optimized for, without necessarily meaning better performance. Much like a student who performs well at memorizing exam questions, but performs poorly 'in the field'. This issue has even been debated in so called 'standardized tests'.<p>Representing a more complex landscape with domain and task specific agents, we should rather develop a set of tests on 'activities' measuring things such as goal completion and competitions for these solutions much like human based coding competitions or debate clubs with human judges with subject-matter expertise.<p>Also, tested on things like adherence to examples given in the prompt (I.e. few shot) and their contextual usage. As fine tuned open sourced models grow more complex we should move away from parameter count and a default set of criteria to testing these LLMs similarly to as we would hiring a team member for a specific set of functions in a given industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455244</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"951b4ef5a6d8707b","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"The Coming Wave","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5074.440716826136,"y":284.36159776279374,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.the-coming-wave.com/\">https://www.the-coming-wave.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a06c7cace896399f","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Reviewing a Dell Linux PC 23 years ago (by me in PCW magazine, Sep 2000)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:30:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4694.440716826136,"y":2436.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html\">https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89116.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"b3939388c4fabaf2","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Sama-Bajau “sea nomads” people gene mutations allow them to free-dive 13 minutes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 12:27:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3946.440716826136,"y":3212.3615977627937,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5bf350e114769088","type":"subflow:75d33be008e5ea9d","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"Super Mario Bros.

into FastAPI apps.<p>I work with notebooks a ton and typically find myself refactoring notebook code into a backend or some other python script. So, I made this to streamline that process.<p>In short, it lets you:\n- Expose cells as HTTP or websockets endpoints with comment declaratives like `@HTTP` and `@WS`\n- Periodically run cells as scheduled tasks for simple data pipelines with `@SCHEDULE`\n- Automatic routing based on filename and directory structure, sort of similar to NextJs. \n- Ignore sandbox files by naming them ‘_sandbox’<p>You can compile your notebooks, which creates a /build folder with a dockerized FastAPI app for local testing or deployment.<p>GitHub repo: <a

release note - https://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml - has the following interesting tidbit:<p>The BigInt primitive (base number format) in JavaScript allows JavaScript to handle excessively large integers (whole numbers). This primitive is especially useful for specialized scientific applications that need very large yet accurate numbers, but has seen widespread adoption for an as of yet unknown reason as part of web frameworks, causing general web compatibility issues for Pale Moon when scripts expect BigInt support and instead have an error thrown. We have now implemented this primitive for use so we no longer have compatibility issues with these frameworks. It is still unknown why BigInt is in use there and for what. Critical note: BigInt might be tempting to consider for JS-backed cryptography but this is very ill-advised, as BigInt operations are, by their nature, not constant-time and allow timing and side-channel attacks.<p>Does anybody have any idea why so many web frameworks are using BigInt?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Finding a trustworthy life partner can be a lifeline and I sure used one to save my relationship. I thought my husband was being unfaithful and I needed proof but was not sure how to get it. That's when I heard about Wizard James, a hacker who specializes in helping people like me. He was very keen on understanding my situation and ensuring that I felt comfortable with his methods. He was able to hack into my husband's devices and spy on him and he provided me with evidence that was essential for my divorce proceedings. I highly recommend wizardjamesrecovery(at)usa(.)com to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. His level of professionalism is explicit and if I could, I would do more than just give him a review.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

all have to upgrade dependencies on our projects and there is no easy way to check what all has changed across multiple versions of a dependency. We end up scrolling through different release changelogs, checking all features, fixes and figuring out if a specific change is relevant to our codebase or not.<p>To simplify this a little, I built a changelog aggregator which allows you to select a range of releases to fetch the changelog, combine different sections and select relevant line items to focus on.<p>Experimentally, it can also scrape some non-GitHub URLs as a lot of enterprise level software organisations don't maintain complete changelog on GitHub releases and instead have it on their website.

I'd prefer to go with some type of SaaS or local app that could make this as painless as possible for us or develop some sort of custom tool for ourselves.<p>So, as I don't really know much about shift planning software offerings, I'm asking you all. Any suggestions?<p>If I were to build it myself, I'd need some platform with an easy way to add all of employees and managers with different roles and the ability to group them into their own units. Then write some algorithms or functions to keep track of what shifts the workers have done and distribute the shifts evenly. It should be possible that every unit had it's own rules.

I just want to reiterate that acid/alkaline in one context (most commonly a description of the hydrogen concentration or other related ions) absolutely does not translate without extra effort and math and chemistry to other contexts (like anything describing calcium as alkaline).

You can still easily see the values flowing through your system (better than just \"prints\"), and it can handle multi-threaded / async scenarios quite nicely. You don't need to manually step through code, you can just \"see\" your data flow, and when you have loops or some other form of iteration, you can see the data for each pass. Coupling this with a good data visualization tool (such as Portal [1]) really feels like magic.

Reality: Tech has created increased pressure for patients to travel to the medical facility rather than care coming to them.<p>One side effect: Doctors who don't do house calls can't incidentally notice things about your lifestyle that may contribute to the problem and may not know to ask or may not ask because it's an offensive thing to say and you may not know to volunteer the info.

Refactoring TypeScipt, for example, with Jetbrains IDE is a breeze, and I think it should be available in developers toolkit whatever their preference is.<p>For some, more dynamic/niche languages (Hello Elixir!), IDEs stand in a way because they take longer to set up and they still don’t produce results as good as glued together scripts and editor macros (side note: macros aren’t only for inserting text, one can pick text under cursor and search for a specific pattern using rg or even send refresh signal to a browser on the other screen).<p>There are also two other layers that I always mention as arguments against IDEs.<p>First is that IDEs change often and no matter how much you try your workflows are going to change. It’s hard to get high proficiency when things are changing and having new IDE feature replacing Your Way is a pain and a learning deterrent (thing that I experienced multiple times).<p>Second is something I call GPS Development. When I work with IDE I tend to not pay attention where am I and where I should be going because hopping navigation is super easy. And then when I am deprived of those tools I’m completely lost and not productive at all. With arguably dumber tools I can open shell and still navigate and edit with whatever editor I have and it still works well. Thing is that with my line of work stuff breaks often and IDEs rightfully decline to work on broken codebase.<p>My current stance is to use whatever you’re most comfortable with (on a unit by unit basis). Struggling with editor or IDE, even the coolest/smartest one, is going to interrupt your thinking process and cause performance hit much bigger than whatever gains it could ever produce.</p>"},{"id":"b7cfb4da02f02470","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by zimpenfish in \"What I have changed my mind about in software development\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:30:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:30:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2663,"y":3262,"wires":[["69427af00552ff9d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463260\n<hr>\n<p>> it seems strange that the author EVER thought that no comments should ever be needed - that seems like a strange and dogmatic conclusion to have come to.<p>Distressingly common, though.

Also, people had already written support utilities like require1k [1] to support cjs in browsers. We don't necessarily need a full bundler - we only need a module analysis step between parse and execute which a native js engine is quite well positioned to facilitate.<p>Having said that, the fact remains that vast majority of pain points that people who actually need to maintain isomorphic libraries face today have nothing to do with synchronous vs asynchronous nature of cjs and esm modules.<p>It is the myriad pointless nuances like default export, namespace imports etc. that are sources of biggest headaches in day to day work. In cjs there is a simple model that a module exports an object and while importing you import that object.

I absolutely, positively <i>love</i> the trigger for the entire thing:<p>> Although there has been work by ICAO and other bodies to eradicate non-unique waypoint names there are duplicates around the world.<p>I mean, this is like seeing the shark fin in Jaws: even ignoring the suspenseful music, you just <i>know</i> there is going to be trouble...<p>Because, it's just perfect, right? A duplicate key, that does <i>usually</i> not occur, so you will happily process your entire triple-ISO-certified test suite, then a million live flight plans, until one day, someone files a flight plan that just happens to include a random collision of the same name for different waypoints on two opposite ends of the world (as an aside, I would <i>love</i> to see the meetings about that: <i>you</i> change your waypoint name! No, this waypoint name is part of our ancient traditions, <i>you</i> change it!).<p>But once that duplicate key is in the system, it goes down <i>hard</i> and keeps doing the exact same thing on restarts, because, well, have to process <i>all</i> the data! The report's conclusion about that whole thing is a masterpiece of British understatement:<p>> Clearly a better way to handle this specific logic error would be for FPRSA-R to identify and remove the message and avoid a critical exception.<p>But anyway, without further ado, here's how <i>you</i> can avoid having similarly embarrassing 18-page PDFs being dedicated to you -- I call it the blast-door pattern, and it works whenever there is a concept of a 'work item' anywhere in your code. Trigger warning: C#, but you can probably manage:<p><pre><code>    enum ItemState\n    {\n        Created,\n        Pending,\n        Completed,\n        Cancelled,\n        Failed\n    }\n\n    void ItemProcessor(ItemQueue queue, ItemProcessor processor, ItemStore store)\n    {\n        var item = queue.Dequeue();\n        if (item?.State = ItemState.Pending)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\n                cts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));\n                processor.Process(cts);\n                item.State = ItemState.Completed;\n            }\n            catch (OperationCanceledException)\n            {\n                item.State = ItemState.Cancelled;\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                item.Exception = ex;\n                item.State = ItemState.Failed;\n            }\n        }\n        if (item != null) store.Add(item);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow, they key takeaways here are:<p>1. Your state enum has an initial value that does <i>not</i> cause it to be processed: that is only done once the value is explicitly set to Pending. This saves you from 'oops, the item creation did not go entirely right, so it was picked up prematurely by the processor, which then crashed';<p>2. Items come from a queue, go back into a different store. You monitor both queue length and the number of items with a bad state in the store; if either number goes up, you have something to look into;<p>3. Set a time limit on processing, which should be entirely ridiculous (so, if item processing normally takes a few milliseconds, make the timeout at least a minute);<p>4. Yes, you catch <i>every</i> exception other than that, because that's like the entire point: crashing work items should be set aside to be looked at.<p>You'll also want some reliable tooling to reprocess failed items as needed, and <i>one last tip</i> before I go: don't wire up individual failed item notifications to your JIRA or something, unless you want to add a 'and then the ticket ID field had an integer overflow' war story to your arsenal...</p>"},{"id":"1a8b9abc2b745f93","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by sverhagen in \"What I have changed my mind about in software development\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:59:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 05:59:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2663,"y":3454,"wires":[["69427af00552ff9d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463416\n<hr>\n<p>I can see a process of triaging and deciding that some code isn't worth testing (yet), but the broader idea of \"this is just a prototype\", I'd like to push back on, unless you work in the rare place where they actually start over after the prototype. \"Blasting out an MVP,\" you say?

The SFC also mandates a track record of experience and expertise on the assigned responsibilities, as well as a direct capability by the MIC to have control on his responsibilities. In clear terms, that means you need to have the actual power of saying \"no\", you need to have the power to hire someone if that is necessary for the safety of the operations, etc.<p>Once you get appointed as MIC, most of your responsibilities are based on _means_, not _end results_:<p>If Karen breaks production, that's not much of your problem (regulatorily speaking) as long as you can demonstrate that you had Karen attend 6h of training this year on how not to break production.<p>So on one hand you have a very heavy personal and professional responsibility.

Now, I’m not arguing against the article, having high student debt is certainly going to impact your ability to own a home, but it’s certainly not the only factor which is at play.<p>Our sister company develops housing for renting. Which was a very lucrative business back when interest rates weren’t evil. What they really do, however, isn’t to rent out homes, it’s making investors money. Keeping rent high is a bigger part of that journey than actually renting out homes, because ultimately the end goal isn’t to own the building, it’s to either sell it or use it as leverage in other projects that makes our investors money. In the city I live in, we have 10.000 empty dental right now, which is quite a high number in a city of a quarter of a million people, but the rent isn’t going down. It’s not going down, because it’s hard to increase if once you lower it, and since the goal isn’t really to rent out these homes but rather to make investors returns, it’s better to ride a decade of empty rentals than to lower the rent. It’s better because the finance data looks better when the potential profits are higher, and as long as that is more important than actually realising that profit then rent isn’t going to come down. Now, obviously there is some competition in the rental market, but every investment bank developer is sort of in our shoes and while it’s obviously a little bit of a game of chicken, it’s not really, because there is still a housing shortage in popular towns. But because we’re playing chicken, the smaller sized rental companies don’t actually need to compete that hard on pricing because we won’t lower ours, and there is enough of a demand that they can get a way with just being in our slipstream.<p>I’m not sure if that’s a thing in America, and there is a lot more to it than this. Here in Denmark we have the same urbanisation and population decline as many other places, so housing is very uneven with urban areas increasing prices while rural areas see theirs plummeting to the point that some homes are frankly unsellable. But it’s mainly due to general debt, and how we let people borrow too much money, which student debt is part of, but not the single contributor to.</p>"},{"id":"50770c457e8e1e82","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by m463 in \"To make dishwashers great again?

Note that the synodic day is the one we on Earth use to define the length of a day for timekeeping purposes--it's a lot easier to measure synodic time than sidereal time.</p>"},{"id":"c802a18705b2389e","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by csaba-boros in \"Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?

Unfortunately the engine requires linux and more importantly x86 (due to asm intructions) so I wasn't able to replicate them yet, but I would expect at least ~1 million requests/s per a pair of actors (e.g. with Erlang), otherwise the overhead is prohibilitely low.<p>The engine also focuses on message passing, but from experience it's very difficult to work with (state machines are hard, especially when working with multiple downstream actors), and at the core actors are more about isolating state without locks than message passing. Swift actors did it right in my opinion, method calls instead of messages are not only easier to reason about, they give additional hints to the runtime when context may switch without involving a scheduler at all (any shared state is slow and inhibits scalability).<p>I actually wrote a header-only library recently (search for \"coroactors\" if you're interested) that implements something similar to Swift actors with C++20 coroutines, and I thought ~10 million requests/s (when uncontended) or ~1-3 million/s (when contended and depending on a scheduler) was a way too high of an overhead, especially when compared to normal method calls with shared state protected with mutexes.

The underlying physics is that the length of the waterline influences the wake system that a boat creates between its bow and tail wave. Those waves interfere constructively and at a certain speed, they start adding up to significant waves - the bow wave starts to pile up more and more. The boat needs to ride up the wave. Drag rises sharply at that point - so a stronger engine helps little at this point.<p>This used to be called the “hull speed”, the maximum speed that a hull can achieve. (It’s grossly simplistic and outdated concept, but a workable estimate).<p>Going beyond requires either a longer waterline or switching from displacement to planing. Some hull shapes can exceed their nominal hull speeds somewhat, but not indefinitely. This is a concern if you tow a small vessel with a larger vessel that can run faster than the small vessels hull speed.

When I was 17, I developed acute neuropathy after covid which was diagnosed via a biopsy. It manifested as orthostatic intolerance caused by insufficient blood flow to my brain. I have been bedridden for around two years now. I was certainly distressed when I got COVID, largely because of a burning pain emanating from my extremities. My uncle died from autoimmune scleroderma. He also developed Lymphoma, whose pathology we believe began with Epstein-Barr.<p>The prevailing hypothesis is a cross reactive species of auto antibodies to the Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor. I unfortunately have not been able to receive a test for this antibody; however, I did test positive for Alpha and Beta adrenergic autoantibodies along with Muscarinic M2 and M4 autoantibodies targeting the hippocampus of my brain. I managed a borderline positive titer for anti TSHDS antibodies, which are correlated with small fiber neuropathy.<p>Normally, I do not comment, and I specifically made an account to type this message while holding a laptop over my head, a difficult task as you can imagine. The medical community is moving too slow in response to post Covid syndromes. I and all the other people affected with neurologic complications would be most appreciative if you all helped review literature on the immune system. It is an awful lot like debugging code! Right now, I read a section about Janus Kinase and TNF alpha. I believe a medication like baracitinib would do a wonderful job mediating mthe inflammatory response. ICU covid patients typically died from TNF alpha, Interleukin 6, and Cysteinyl Leukotriene 1 mediated by 5 lipoxygenase synthesis from arachidonic acid.

I consider myself average looking, and I have a tendency to get fat very easily.<p>Bro. When did I say looks is the only factor of attraction for women? Your imagination is running wild and cooking up things I didn't say. LOOKS matter for men, For women they're judgement on attraction is MUCH more multi-faceted. They judge, status, they judge personality, they judge wealth, they judge career, they judge race, they judge humor, and they judge Looks. Looks is one dimension of multiple variables.<p>BUT here's the thing, looks HELP. It's a factor but men can get around that factor. If you have looks, you can do a lot worse in other categories. This isn't the point. The point is that women are HIGHLY selective. Even though women are multifaceted in their approach their bar is extremely high. Men are one dimensional in attraction but they have a lot of leeway and make a lot of exceptions.<p>That's why you see the data in dating apps. 80% of Women are pining for the top 20% of men and men are only matching with the bottom 80% of men. That's it, facts.<p>>I dated, literally, dozens of women during my years of dating app cruising, and ALL of them would emphatically explain that the main reason that they accepted to go out with me, was that I NEVER ASKED for, nor sent/asked permission for sending nude pics to them. IT REALLY is a deal breaker and a huge advantage on this market, to know these simple rules.<p>You're blind. You know when you ask a woman if looks matter they always tell you it doesn't right? They're outright blind themselves. Never ask a woman for dating advice they tell you they want a sensitive man, they want someone who cares for them, they never tell you what they really want which is a 6 foot white chad extremely rich man who will dominate them and make them feel small and feminine. You let women tell you their delusions and you eat it up and become delusional yourself. This is what you are: Living in the clouds.<p>The data shows the average man only matches 2 out 8 swipes while the average woman matches 8/10. That means women aren't even matching with most men. MOST men don't have the OPPORTUNITY to launch out a dick pic. What that means is those two men getting matched are getting hundreds of matches. Basically they can do whatever the hell they want because they have what you termed indefinite supply.  Think about it. If dick pics don't work why are certain men sending it?<p>I hate to break it to you, but any person of average intelligence can figure out dick pics don't work. If you're below average intelligence experience will eventually teach you dick pics don't work. Your advice is telling men to stop driving a car into a wall and then you walk away like your some kind of genius for that discovery. Let's just say you're not the brightest tool in the toolbox but that's besides the point. The point is that if there are still men sending dick pics it means for a certain segment of men it works. Like I said Chris hemsworth can send a dick pic to any woman and she will send him her current location and phone number and tell her to come pick her up in the middle of the night no creeper shit intended.<p>>Don't be fat. Don't be unemployed. Pay for the dinner. Do not put sex in the conversation.<p><i>rolls eyes</i> the irony here is that fat is actually more acceptable for women. In terms of physicality women place the most desirability on height. \"Don't be short\" would be the perfect addition to your little list of useless tips. EVERYBODY knows about what you just said. Garbage.<p>The other thing, \"Do not put sex in the conversation\" just shows you have no game. The art is to pick the time, pick that right place and work it into the conversation and get her horny. I'm guessing you play lame nice guy routines and get by purely off your looks. Lucky you, but you didn't earn shit and you certainly shouldn't be giving out advice given how little you know. The true players know the art of conversation and I've seen fat short guys get girls to break their rules and bed them on the first date. You aren't even close.<p>>I can't stand men that make excuses in the style of yours<p>Bro, when the fuck did I make an excuse? I am simply spitting facts. I'm saying this is the current state of the world. I'm pointing out where your wrong and when things you say are patently false because you lack knowledge. The game is harder for men that's just reality in the same way the game is just harder for overweight women. It's reality. Stating facts is NOT an excuse. It's a statement about reality. Nowhere did I tell other men to give up, nor did I say I'm giving up, I'm just laying out the conditions of the field. Jesus. Now you're acting like your some expert guru.<p>>. If a woman is born \"ugly\", it's game over. She's probably going to be a bottom feeder on the dating market. I feel REALLY sorry for ugly women when I meet one, I have a sister that is in this situation and it is not a good life.<p>This is true. The game is unfortunately even harder for your sister depending on how ugly she is. If can very much be game over her if she's disfigured. Depending on how bad her situation is her only strategy is to lower her standards by a lot. Either way, this has NOTHING to do with what I'm saying.<p>You're acting like a dating coach, and I'm telling you, you don't know shit. You have no clue about what's going on with modern dating.<p>>Choose your destiny dude.<p>I'm in a fucking relationship. God. Wake up.</p>"},{"id":"16f50482937de4e9","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by waste_monk in \"Coffee in a Can\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:43:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3782.169169939703,"y":20,"wires":[["598766f9a9cf94ab"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463731\n<hr>\n<p>Apparently the self-heating is chemical, triggering whatever mechanism mixes a quantity of quicklime with water, and the result is exothermic.<p>I tried a self-heating coffee once and to be fair it did heat up pretty well, but the coffee was overly bitter and kind of gross.

Luckily I have a job, it's not as well paid as the same job in other areas but I'm employed and don't pay a huge housing cost. But I'm miserable, it's a horrible place to live (especially as a childless 30-something single person) and I'm looking to move somewhere that's nicer.<p>I'm really struggling to do that, because trading up in areas is difficult, I'm looking at a doubling of housing costs (plus all the other costs of moving) in exchange for ~20-30% more pay in a more affluent area. There are a lot of people like me, trapped in crappy areas with low housing costs and unable to trade up despite being full-time employed. I feel like I just exist here, weekends are my escape but I need to escape forever.</p>"},{"id":"ed7d066a3ce20352","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by throwbadubadu in \"What I have changed my mind about in software development\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:48:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:48:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2663,"y":4062,"wires":[["69427af00552ff9d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463771\n<hr>\n<p>Yes, especially for some unit testing is done like \"atomic testing\" (test the smallest possible part, if they could they would test individual lines), but turns out that the putting together is another crucial part with often not less complexity and where the corner cases come in. In that sense even not much like the unit vs integration testing difference & debates, because that line is blurry and just depends on your definition of an unit: It may be the single heavy algorithmic function, it may be the whole state machine, it may even be two heavily dependent and cooperating tasks in an embedded RTOS... and you always know you are in trouble if people discuss more what an unit test is and not is (instead of the value whatever thing provides).<p>I \"love\" btw those code bases rich with tests but 99% of the time not finding a bug, but breaking on the tiniest detail change.. not supporting refactoring like it should be but making it slow and everyone wanting not to refactor because of the crap test rat tail.</p>"},{"id":"423aa3db6f8e44bc","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by solresol in \"Chronic fatigue syndrome may have a post-viral infection origin\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:48:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:48:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1252.8464057414142,"y":4371.377659166952,"wires":[["e19e331df3204ab3"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463770\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"88cda11dee8f3599","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by antupis in \"RestGPT\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:48:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 06:48:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2843,"y":3502,"wires":[["4599c487216b5f28"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37463769\n<hr>\n<p>M2 max studio is 2000$.</p>"},{"id":"8d0acce95cc1123c","type":"subflow:4c38bb819973f5c8","z":"686a84e2a22b5553","name":"New comment by tonymillion in \"Can you explain Transformers in one sentence?
