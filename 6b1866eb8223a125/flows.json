CPU, memory, and display hardware wasn't there to do anything useful with alpha (other than 1-bit masks used for game characters and GUI icons).<p>OTOH Lucasfilm (and other film visual effects companies) had a long history of using mattes, the physical photography equivalents of alpha compositing. When you see a group of Stormtroopers marching inside a Death Star hangar in 1977 \"Star Wars\", the hangar is a matte painting. They were typically created by artists directly on a large glass that was carefully placed in front of the camera to create the illusion.<p>Porter and Duff came up with a compositing model that's appealingly simple: it's a single formula, three variables, and you get 12 compositing operators by simply enumerating the combinations.<p>You can still find these Porter-Duff operators pretty much anywhere that 2D graphics are processed. They're in HTML Canvas, PDF, Apple CoreGraphics...<p>But, as neatly mathematical as these operators are, most of them aren't really practical for rendering actual scenes consisting of graphics layers. They're not terribly intuitive for designers, and they don't even attempt to simulate the effects of combining light.<p>So when Photoshop was created, its designers needed a set of blending operations (initially for drawing tools, and soon after for combining layers, which were introduced in PS version 3.0). Exposing the Porter-Duff operators to designers in the Photoshop GUI wouldn't have been very useful.<p>Instead they came up with a set of blending modes that were loosely derived from operations that you could do on physical photography negatives, since that was the inspiration for the application. (The PS blending modes still retain names like \"dodge\" and \"burn\" which refer to darkroom techniques that no designer aged under 50 probably remembers.)<p>These PS blending modes are conceptually pretty much the opposite of the Porter-Duff modes: they're not mathematically rigorous, but just a collection of algorithms that could be executed in reasonable time on a 68k processor back in the early 1990s. These original limitations are visible in the design of the algorithms: for example, they don't even try to account for gamma correction in the source images, which means that the algorithms do a rather poor job of simulating the behavior of actual light. (Photoshop has later added \"linear\" versions of some blending modes to address this.)</p>"},{"id":"2871ead1469279ab","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by oever in \"Preserving trust in photojournalism through authentication technology\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3618,"y":4005,"wires":[["2ee6eddb38c1bcf2"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403308\n<hr>\n<p>Cryptographically signing GPS signals makes it harder to spoof GPS coordinates but does not stop it completely.<p>A spoofer could obtain signed GPS signals from the time and location where they are claiming to have taken a photo and combine them with a photo taken in a different time and place.</p>"},{"id":"d2c64ce2c4862d4","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"As X bleeds cash, Musk threatens Anti-Defamation League with defamation lawsuit\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3015.8972048771757,"y":3062.754054140526,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403307\n<hr>\n<p>That'd be nice, but, no federal anti-SLAPP law exists at this time.<p>e.g. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/its-time-federal-anti-slapp-law-protect-online-speakers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/its-time-federal-anti-...</a></p>"},{"id":"6302a4925bc9732d","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by ahoka in \"Air Canada apologizes, women kicked off flight for refusing vomit-covered seats\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2955.8972048771757,"y":2838.754054140526,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403305\n<hr>\n<p>Wow that is even worse.</p>"},{"id":"d155d993905d328e","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by 9baka in \"Chinchilla’s death\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2943.8972048771757,"y":1046.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403304\n<hr>\n<p>What is a pareto frontier? what?? and what is \"FLOPS\" in the graph?

Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.<p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.<p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].<p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.<p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.<p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.<p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   \nI’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well.

After a few months we already had customers (even a big one), so we decided to go all in and incorporate via Stripe Atlas and open an Inc.<p>Things were going great and we quickly closed a 100k$ round (\"friends & friends\" round) issuing convertible notes to our investors.\nWe kept growing till COVID hit hard. Our customers had been hit hard and we lost 90% of our MRR.<p>We had to fire all our employees, but we kept the lights on thanks to the money in our bank account. We kept developing with the hope to acquire new customers and be successful after the black swan.<p>Well, the market was changed after 2yrs of COVID, and our SaaS was not as appealing as it was before. We did our best, we kept improving the product and partially pivoting, but we didn't acquire any new customer.<p>Our last mid-sized customer decided not to renew a few months ago, so we decided to shut down the company. Pivoting is not an option, we should rebuild the product from the ground up to really change the trajectory.<p>We invested ~4years (and our money), and we're super tired and half broken now. Raising money again is a desperate and impossible thing to do with our numbers. \nI'm sure the code base alone is worth something. We may try to sell it, but finding a buyer is super hard with 0$ MRR. We may spend months talking to potential buyers and burning our own money to refund almost nothing to our investors.<p>The convertible notes reached the maturity date 2y ago, but they were not converted into shares, nor were cash payments requested.\nWe (the founders) know we already lost time and money, but we don't want to keep bleeding.<p>Since we have less than $1,000 in our bank account, what's the cheapest way to shutdown everything?<p>Thank you in advance,\nan exausted founder.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403452\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403452</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"6e129108fdd11cce","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Commit Mono: neutral programming typeface for a better reading experience","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:57:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:57:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3911.8972048771757,"y":1718.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono\">https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403448\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403448</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"a58d87c68f5652d6","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Show HN: Coworker – An Open Source AI assistant for your company Slack","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:57:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:57:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2207.8972048771757,"y":1774.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Hi HN,<p>We’re Raza and Jordan, the founders of Humanloop. At our company hackathon, we built an initial prototype for an extensible AI assistant that lives in Slack.<p>ChatGPT is incredibly useful. But it’s also very limited. It doesn’t have the context of your work or your company. It can’t take actions beyond sending you messages in text. It has no memory.<p>That’s why we built Coworker. Coworker is a GPT-4 powered assistant that lives in Slack. It's not like normal AI assistants though. Instead of being a chatbot, it sits in the background and reads each message in context. Then, it if thinks it can help it sends the user a message, gets approvals and then takes action.<p>To make Coworker, we made heavy use of GPT-4‘s function calling. There’s a central decision-making agent that reads every message and takes action by outputting a “function call”. This is a JSON object that specifics what the agent wants to do — whether that’s messaging the user or making an API call. After the agent asks to do an action, we get a confirmation from the user and then execute the API call.<p>A crucial part of a good coworker is that you can teach them to do new things. We've made it easy for you extend the capability of Coworker, all you have to do is write a Python function with a good docstring and save it to the “tools” folder. Over time, your team can add more and more capabilities that seem relevant.<p>We chose to do this in Slack because it's an incredible repository of company information. The AI can understand the context of your work. It’s also a place where important information gets shared but also lost. Coworker can really help with this. For example, if someone in your company mentions a bug in Slack, Coworker will offer to create a Linear ticket.<p>We built Coworker in Python using OpenAI GPT-4, Humanloop and the Slack API. To deploy the bot we used Railway.app. This is the result of a 24-hour hackathon but we really hope to keep working on it and make it something genuinely useful both to us at Humanloop and to the wider community. Our GitHub repo contains ideas for extending it.<p>Would love your feedback, ideas and contributions!<p>Warm wishes,<p>Raza and Jordan</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403446\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403446</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"523be5d05c5eab3a","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"First 6 Gatekeepers wrt DMA: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:56:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:56:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2835.8972048771757,"y":2166.754054140526,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission/111017787528870307\">https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission/111017787528870307</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403442\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403442</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"7a5db9b9466e10aa","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"The UK Is Poised to Force a Bad Law on the Internet","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:52:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:52:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2635.8972048771757,"y":1158.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-uk-is-poised-to-force-a-bad-law-on-the-internet\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-uk-is-poised-to-force-a-bad-law-on-the-internet</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403427\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403427</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8ab99c3b8b511c35","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by jodrellblank in \"Microsoft to stop forcing Windows 11 users into Edge in EU countries\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:02:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:02:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2207.8972048771757,"y":2838.754054140526,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403476\n<hr>\n<p>Did you read the headline about the Air Canada customer threatened with the no fly list if they don’t sit in the vomit smeared seat?

When you run code on your server and people interact with it over the network that's not a distribution. If it was a distribution there would be no need for AGPL. GPL would be sufficient.<p>I think you’re misreading this part of my comment: MongoDB <i>is</i> (or at least, was) AGPL, and AGPL defines network access as distribution. So I would have to justify whether offering my proxy service to network access counts as distributing MongoDB, or if laundering it through a proxy works around this.<p>> AGPL would protect MongoDB in that scenario because you are allowing remote users to interact with MongoDB over a computer network. That this interaction happens to be taking place through a proxy shouldn't be relevant.<p>Well, that’s the thought experiment that my example is intended to provoke… it seems <i>obvious</i> that my dumb proxy is a way to work around the AGPL, but what if we tweak the example? What if I make a web UI where you type mongo commands and it gives you the result? (Still pretty obvious, no?) What if I make a simple dumb CRUD app that happens to use MongoDB? (Less obvious…) what if the CRUD app is itself an extremely thin wrapper, and although it doesn’t implement any MongoDB protocols, it leverages built-in mongoDB functionality for 99% of the logic?<p>The point is, it’s not hard to imagine a legal theory that says “if network access equals distribution, then network access equals a derived/combined work”. It’s the theory that the legal departments of several companies I’ve worked for have taken. And I’d argue that if you have a proprietary product that uses an AGPL service as part of the backend, you have a rather large reason to be worried.</p>"},{"id":"6e0db6322ff4a39d","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by kalleboo in \"The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2775.8972048771757,"y":1774.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403504\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"151d93d15d837278","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by athanassios in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3091.8972048771757,"y":990.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403503\n<hr>\n<p>Great job, XTDB's utilization of Apache Arrow for in-memory columnar data structures is highly appreciated. Polars dataframe library in my benchmark is also based on Apache arrow. Thank you for the reference on XTDB benchmark datasets. How can I import `tsv` and/or n-triplets file into v2 XTDB so I can run a couple of queries on WatDiv ? It worth mentioning here that there is a growing interest on extracting subsets of data from large knowledge triplets bases and there are specialized tools for this (e.g. KGTK). I guess v2 XTDB with datalog will make this process a lot easier.<p>Well, regarding the \"one size fits all\" database engine, I would rephrase this as \"one size fits the most\" :-). Your reference about SingleStore (it has a remarkable performance similar to ClickHouse), Rowstore and Columnstore engines in one DBMS, fits the most if not all the cases. But in my opinion, the ideal solution to the DBMS-database challenge resides at the application level and within the realm of database modeling. I would contend that in today's landscape, it's the (V)ariety dimension of big data, that poses the most significant challenge – specifically, the seamless integration of data from various sources. And of course if you manage to lift the heavy load (ETL), as Stonebraker said, you run into the graph/traversal problem.<p>If you take into account the extensive and continuous development efforts spanning many years, along with the evolving trends in the realm of database query languages, all aimed at enhancing the often troublesome SQL and its numerous alternatives like SPARQL, graph query languages, noSQL, and newSQL, you'll begin to grasp that there is a fundamental issue underlying all of these approaches.<p>Primarily, it's the lack of a distinct separation between the logical and computational layer and the storage (physical layer). Only recently, this crucial aspect has begun to take center stage in the development of DBMS systems featuring multiple storage engines. Was it Datomic that played a pioneering role in this shift ? The second equally import aspect that it is still heavily underestimated nowadays is the principle of compositionality both at the level of the query language and the data types. Datalog, especially if it is used in a logic programming environment like Clojure, is in the right direction. I will argue, that several Datalog systems, which exclusively adhere to the EAV/RDF data model, lack a crucial element. They are forcing users to create queries and data models through the cumbersome process of breaking down and building n-ary relations from triplets.

They literally call you an anti-semite if you say something mundane and then <i>someone else</i> replies with something that a machine thinks is anti-semitic. By that standard they deserve to lose any lawsuits heading their way, and lose them badly.<p>I thought they couldn't make themselves look any worse, but then they presented their examples of \"anti-semitic tweets\". It's a guy who was replied to the ADL and criticized them! They claim that he took their words out of context and this prompted \"anti-semitic responses\" which they, of course, do not list.<p>This is an absurdly blatant attempt to claim that anyone who criticises the ADL itself, as an institution, is an awful Nazi. They don't even try to present real anti-semitism.<p>This is all totally standard nowadays. Many groups have complained about this. They go after newspapers, TV channels, social networks, all of it. Any organization that isn't explicitly left wing gets attacked like this. Left wing activist orgs have a goal of making disagreement either outright illegal or impossible via private sector control, hence why they always go after advertisers, payment processors and other \"nodes\" as they put it. Their goal is very clear by now, it is the obliteration of any and all ideological disagreement.<p>Am rooting for Musk in this fight.</p>"},{"id":"4b9c4bf49935077d","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by lioeters in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:12:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:12:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2495.8972048771757,"y":990.7540541405258,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403535\n<hr>\n<p>It's one of those rhetorical tricks being used to manipulate public opinion, where any criticism of the status quo is branded as \"un-American\" and \"un-patriotic\".
