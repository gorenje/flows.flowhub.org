CPU, memory, and display hardware wasn't there to do anything useful with alpha (other than 1-bit masks used for game characters and GUI icons).<p>OTOH Lucasfilm (and other film visual effects companies) had a long history of using mattes, the physical photography equivalents of alpha compositing. When you see a group of Stormtroopers marching inside a Death Star hangar in 1977 \"Star Wars\", the hangar is a matte painting. They were typically created by artists directly on a large glass that was carefully placed in front of the camera to create the illusion.<p>Porter and Duff came up with a compositing model that's appealingly simple: it's a single formula, three variables, and you get 12 compositing operators by simply enumerating the combinations.<p>You can still find these Porter-Duff operators pretty much anywhere that 2D graphics are processed. They're in HTML Canvas, PDF, Apple CoreGraphics...<p>But, as neatly mathematical as these operators are, most of them aren't really practical for rendering actual scenes consisting of graphics layers. They're not terribly intuitive for designers, and they don't even attempt to simulate the effects of combining light.<p>So when Photoshop was created, its designers needed a set of blending operations (initially for drawing tools, and soon after for combining layers, which were introduced in PS version 3.0). Exposing the Porter-Duff operators to designers in the Photoshop GUI wouldn't have been very useful.<p>Instead they came up with a set of blending modes that were loosely derived from operations that you could do on physical photography negatives, since that was the inspiration for the application. (The PS blending modes still retain names like \"dodge\" and \"burn\" which refer to darkroom techniques that no designer aged under 50 probably remembers.)<p>These PS blending modes are conceptually pretty much the opposite of the Porter-Duff modes: they're not mathematically rigorous, but just a collection of algorithms that could be executed in reasonable time on a 68k processor back in the early 1990s. These original limitations are visible in the design of the algorithms: for example, they don't even try to account for gamma correction in the source images, which means that the algorithms do a rather poor job of simulating the behavior of actual light. (Photoshop has later added \"linear\" versions of some blending modes to address this.)</p>"},{"id":"2871ead1469279ab","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by oever in \"Preserving trust in photojournalism through authentication technology\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3080,"y":1420,"wires":[["2ee6eddb38c1bcf2"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403308\n<hr>\n<p>Cryptographically signing GPS signals makes it harder to spoof GPS coordinates but does not stop it completely.<p>A spoofer could obtain signed GPS signals from the time and location where they are claiming to have taken a photo and combine them with a photo taken in a different time and place.</p>"},{"id":"d2c64ce2c4862d4","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"As X bleeds cash, Musk threatens Anti-Defamation League with defamation lawsuit\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:29:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4120,"y":6068,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403307\n<hr>\n<p>That'd be nice, but, no federal anti-SLAPP law exists at this time.<p>e.g. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/its-time-federal-anti-slapp-law-protect-online-speakers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/its-time-federal-anti-...</a></p>"},{"id":"6302a4925bc9732d","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by ahoka in \"Air Canada apologizes, women kicked off flight for refusing vomit-covered seats\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5884,"y":5452,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403305\n<hr>\n<p>Wow that is even worse.</p>"},{"id":"d155d993905d328e","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by 9baka in \"Chinchilla’s death\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:28:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3452,"y":3124,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403304\n<hr>\n<p>What is a pareto frontier? what?? and what is \"FLOPS\" in the graph?

Because they don’t explicitly use some of that data, they forget they have exposed it.<p>This is certainly a protection that we’ve lost as we moved away from server rendered architecture, where no APIs are exposed and only explicitly needed data is sent to the client.

Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.<p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.<p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].<p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.<p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.<p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.<p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   \nI’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well.

After a few months we already had customers (even a big one), so we decided to go all in and incorporate via Stripe Atlas and open an Inc.<p>Things were going great and we quickly closed a 100k$ round (\"friends & friends\" round) issuing convertible notes to our investors.\nWe kept growing till COVID hit hard. Our customers had been hit hard and we lost 90% of our MRR.<p>We had to fire all our employees, but we kept the lights on thanks to the money in our bank account. We kept developing with the hope to acquire new customers and be successful after the black swan.<p>Well, the market was changed after 2yrs of COVID, and our SaaS was not as appealing as it was before. We did our best, we kept improving the product and partially pivoting, but we didn't acquire any new customer.<p>Our last mid-sized customer decided not to renew a few months ago, so we decided to shut down the company. Pivoting is not an option, we should rebuild the product from the ground up to really change the trajectory.<p>We invested ~4years (and our money), and we're super tired and half broken now. Raising money again is a desperate and impossible thing to do with our numbers. \nI'm sure the code base alone is worth something. We may try to sell it, but finding a buyer is super hard with 0$ MRR. We may spend months talking to potential buyers and burning our own money to refund almost nothing to our investors.<p>The convertible notes reached the maturity date 2y ago, but they were not converted into shares, nor were cash payments requested.\nWe (the founders) know we already lost time and money, but we don't want to keep bleeding.<p>Since we have less than $1,000 in our bank account, what's the cheapest way to shutdown everything?<p>Thank you in advance,\nan exausted founder.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403452\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403452</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"6e129108fdd11cce","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Commit Mono: neutral programming typeface for a better reading experience","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:57:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:57:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4588,"y":3796,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono\">https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403448\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403448</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"523be5d05c5eab3a","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"First 6 Gatekeepers wrt DMA: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:56:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:56:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6232,"y":4236,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission/111017787528870307\">https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission/111017787528870307</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403442\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403442</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"7a5db9b9466e10aa","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"The UK Is Poised to Force a Bad Law on the Internet","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:52:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:52:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4716,"y":3180,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-uk-is-poised-to-force-a-bad-law-on-the-internet\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-uk-is-poised-to-force-a-bad-law-on-the-internet</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403427\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403427</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8ab99c3b8b511c35","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by jodrellblank in \"Microsoft to stop forcing Windows 11 users into Edge in EU countries\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:02:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:02:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4200,"y":5284,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403476\n<hr>\n<p>Did you read the headline about the Air Canada customer threatened with the no fly list if they don’t sit in the vomit smeared seat?

With C++20 ability to test the library upon use additional guarantees can be put in place (accordingly to the quality of tests). Tests are executed at compile-time during include/import so there is no run-time overhead and compile-time overhead is minimal. With this approach, it can be basically guaranteed that the tested features are working as expected without any leaks and/or UB if the library compiles upon include/import. The feedback is immediate and constantly verified making the solution reliable and without run-time surprises on the client side.</p>"},{"id":"70d0a7f5b313112a","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by nechmads in \"Memxi – Never Forget Anything\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:00:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:00:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":573,"y":1200,"wires":[["3d5f7529f129ae19"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403472\n<hr>\n<p>The bookmarking tool for the AI era.

When you run code on your server and people interact with it over the network that's not a distribution. If it was a distribution there would be no need for AGPL. GPL would be sufficient.<p>I think you’re misreading this part of my comment: MongoDB <i>is</i> (or at least, was) AGPL, and AGPL defines network access as distribution. So I would have to justify whether offering my proxy service to network access counts as distributing MongoDB, or if laundering it through a proxy works around this.<p>> AGPL would protect MongoDB in that scenario because you are allowing remote users to interact with MongoDB over a computer network. That this interaction happens to be taking place through a proxy shouldn't be relevant.<p>Well, that’s the thought experiment that my example is intended to provoke… it seems <i>obvious</i> that my dumb proxy is a way to work around the AGPL, but what if we tweak the example? What if I make a web UI where you type mongo commands and it gives you the result? (Still pretty obvious, no?) What if I make a simple dumb CRUD app that happens to use MongoDB? (Less obvious…) what if the CRUD app is itself an extremely thin wrapper, and although it doesn’t implement any MongoDB protocols, it leverages built-in mongoDB functionality for 99% of the logic?<p>The point is, it’s not hard to imagine a legal theory that says “if network access equals distribution, then network access equals a derived/combined work”. It’s the theory that the legal departments of several companies I’ve worked for have taken. And I’d argue that if you have a proprietary product that uses an AGPL service as part of the backend, you have a rather large reason to be worried.</p>"},{"id":"6e0db6322ff4a39d","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by kalleboo in \"The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5156,"y":3796,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403504\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"151d93d15d837278","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by athanassios in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:07:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4256,"y":3012,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403503\n<hr>\n<p>Great job, XTDB's utilization of Apache Arrow for in-memory columnar data structures is highly appreciated. Polars dataframe library in my benchmark is also based on Apache arrow. Thank you for the reference on XTDB benchmark datasets. How can I import `tsv` and/or n-triplets file into v2 XTDB so I can run a couple of queries on WatDiv ? It worth mentioning here that there is a growing interest on extracting subsets of data from large knowledge triplets bases and there are specialized tools for this (e.g. KGTK). I guess v2 XTDB with datalog will make this process a lot easier.<p>Well, regarding the \"one size fits all\" database engine, I would rephrase this as \"one size fits the most\" :-). Your reference about SingleStore (it has a remarkable performance similar to ClickHouse), Rowstore and Columnstore engines in one DBMS, fits the most if not all the cases. But in my opinion, the ideal solution to the DBMS-database challenge resides at the application level and within the realm of database modeling. I would contend that in today's landscape, it's the (V)ariety dimension of big data, that poses the most significant challenge – specifically, the seamless integration of data from various sources. And of course if you manage to lift the heavy load (ETL), as Stonebraker said, you run into the graph/traversal problem.<p>If you take into account the extensive and continuous development efforts spanning many years, along with the evolving trends in the realm of database query languages, all aimed at enhancing the often troublesome SQL and its numerous alternatives like SPARQL, graph query languages, noSQL, and newSQL, you'll begin to grasp that there is a fundamental issue underlying all of these approaches.<p>Primarily, it's the lack of a distinct separation between the logical and computational layer and the storage (physical layer). Only recently, this crucial aspect has begun to take center stage in the development of DBMS systems featuring multiple storage engines. Was it Datomic that played a pioneering role in this shift ? The second equally import aspect that it is still heavily underestimated nowadays is the principle of compositionality both at the level of the query language and the data types. Datalog, especially if it is used in a logic programming environment like Clojure, is in the right direction. I will argue, that several Datalog systems, which exclusively adhere to the EAV/RDF data model, lack a crucial element. They are forcing users to create queries and data models through the cumbersome process of breaking down and building n-ary relations from triplets. I believe that the remedy lies in developing robust transformation functions capable of handling input and output across triplets, tabular, or nested data structures.</p>"},{"id":"7f8aeac190035df1","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by conorkelly1 in \"ConvoClash – LLMs debate each other\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:06:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:06:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":454.21528319274216,"y":2300.2807852398296,"wires":[["5343987be23d6dc8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403499\n<hr>\n<p>Love the UI!</p>"},{"id":"94f404ebae0bf32b","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by dredmorbius in \"Elon Musk threatens to sue Anti-Defamation League over lost X revenue\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:06:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:06:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4220,"y":5508,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403498\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"63a4400ae9f9d5cd","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by danbruc in \"Black Hole Electron\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:06:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:06:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2210,"y":1740,"wires":[["a9fceb4d4cf3ff38"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403497\n<hr>\n<p>Singularity has nothing to do with any distance, it is a divergence at some point.

They claim that he took their words out of context and this prompted \"anti-semitic responses\" which they, of course, do not list.<p>This is an absurdly blatant attempt to claim that anyone who criticises the ADL itself, as an institution, is an awful Nazi. They don't even try to present real anti-semitism.<p>This is all totally standard nowadays. Many groups have complained about this. They go after newspapers, TV channels, social networks, all of it. Any organization that isn't explicitly left wing gets attacked like this. Left wing activist orgs have a goal of making disagreement either outright illegal or impossible via private sector control, hence why they always go after advertisers, payment processors and other \"nodes\" as they put it. Their goal is very clear by now, it is the obliteration of any and all ideological disagreement.<p>Am rooting for Musk in this fight.</p>"},{"id":"4b9c4bf49935077d","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by lioeters in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:12:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:12:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7188,"y":2956,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403535\n<hr>\n<p>It's one of those rhetorical tricks being used to manipulate public opinion, where any criticism of the status quo is branded as \"un-American\" and \"un-patriotic\".

There's endless room to debate what those rules are or should be, but in general the social order thus created is better for everyone - including you.

Thanks for sharing.<p>> <i>In many ways the great quest of Doug Lenat’s life was an attempt to follow on directly from the work of Aristotle and Leibniz.</i><p>Such a wonderful, respectful retrospective of Lenat's ideas and work.<p>> <i>I think Doug viewed CYC as some kind of formalized idealization of how he imagined human minds work: providing a framework into which a large collection of (fairly undifferentiated) knowledge about the world could be “poured”. At some level it was a very “pure AI” concept: set up a generic brain-like thing, then “it’ll just do the rest”. But Doug still felt that the thing had to operate according to logic, and that what was fed into it also had to consist of knowledge packaged up in the form of logic.</i><p>I've always wanted CYC, or something like it, to be correct. Like somehow it'd fulfill my need for the universe to be knowable, legible. If human reason & logic could be encoded, then maybe things would start to make sense.<p>Alas.<p>Back when SemanticWeb was the hotness, I was a firm ontology partisan. After working on customer's use cases, and given enough time to work thru the stages of grief, I grudgingly accept that folksonomy is probably true.<p>To this day, statistics based approaches make me uncomfortable, perhaps even anxious. My pragmatism motivated holistic worldview is always running up against my reductionist impulses. Paradox in a nutshell.<p>Enough about me.<p>I do appreciate Wolfram comparing his theory of computation (for AI) to Lenat's encoding of heuristics. It's a nice reminder of their lineages. And I hope the future holds some kind of synthesis of their two strategies.</p>"},{"id":"3168e93d46100091","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by abwizz in \"Engineer’s guide to career growth: Advice from my time at Stripe and Facebook\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:25:38 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:25:38 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":950,"y":4200,"wires":[["c5aa8e5a6eada27e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403591\n<hr>\n<p>> The whole cottage industry around work is a festering wound at this point.<p>and (we?) the internet natives are most prone to this assessment as growing up in a world of free ideas (foss) wrecks any connection between work and reward.</p>"},{"id":"2c34e71b4d0c1479","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by smfugit in \"Ask HN: Isn't it hard to find a programmer's job that is a bit greener?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:24:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:24:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6224,"y":6180,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403590\n<hr>\n<p>Get used to it.

The C++ type system can't really do this, so it's contorted to try to get as close as we can, and the results aren't pretty.<p>1. Consider this Rust type: enum InvisibleDog { } - this is an Empty Type, there are no Invisible Dogs, Rust is OK with the existence of this type, although since it's uninhabited there can be no instances (and the type accordingly has no size, not zero size, no size at all). Such types don't make a whole lot of sense concretely, but they're crucial to good generic programming.<p>In C++ we can't have such a type, the closest we can attempt is a std::variant whose only actual variant is valueless_by_exception and has a size of at least 1 byte. This is a disaster because it completely fails to achieve what we meant.<p>2. OK how about enum JustOneByte { Byte(u8) } - this type is as its name suggests, just a byte, Rust's u8 type. Its representation is accordingly one byte.<p>But with std::variant we can't do that either, C++ has to account for valueless_by_exception and so it has to carry around a discriminator, so that it can discriminate between Byte, the only actual possible value of this type, and valueless_by_exception. As a result in C this type is larger than its \"real\" content, which is just one byte.<p>3. We can't do the guaranteed niche optimisation either. Rust's Option is literally just a sum type. It's not magic (in that sense, it's effectively a langitem so it is magic in some other ways). But despite the lack of magic Option<&T> is guaranteed to be the same size as &T is thanks to the guaranteed niche optimisation. C++ can't do that either.</p>"},{"id":"c8f55d4aa559d2a4","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by lhl in \"The Eleuther AI Mafia\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:35:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:35:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3452,"y":3404,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403654\n<hr>\n<p>The wiki looks like a much better organized starting point!

How did you decide what to work on in the beginning?\n2. Were you solving your own problem? If not, what did you do to better understand the problem/domain?\n3. Looking back what was the high-level process/steps to validate your startup idea? How long did each phase take?\n4. Did the thing you originally set out to work on change? In what way?\n5. What approach did you use for defining your target customer?\n6. How did you find and engage with your target customer?\n7. What did you measure to help you validate the value proposition?\n8. How much of your validation was a gut feeling vs. actual data?\n9. Did you create what customers asked, or did you land on a need that customers didn’t even know they wanted?\n10. How did you approach validating your growth thesis? 11. What tools did you use, how long did it take, what worked?\n12. How long did it take to validate your startup idea altogether?\n13. In hindsight, what do you think could have helped you to save time?\n14. What tools did you use in the process of validating your startup idea?\n15. Did you build anything to help you validate your startup idea by getting early user feedback? How much time did you spend on your early MVPs before getting it in the hands of potential customers?\n16. What was your biggest hurdle in validating your startup idea?\n17. What aspects of the startup validation phase did you automate? If you did it now, what would you consider to automate?\n18. What did you do in the startup validation phase that you think is outside of the typical advice?\n19. What did you do in the process to validate your startup idea that you believe an AI would never have been able to do?<p>If you have any suggestions on questions that I should add or tweak, please drop a comment.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403668\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403668</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5c4f2f9b8c330f25","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"China Decides iPhones Pose a National Security Risk","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:37:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:37:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3880,"y":3572,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://me.pcmag.com/en/mobile-phones/19154/china-decides-iphones-pose-a-national-security-risk\">https://me.pcmag.com/en/mobile-phones/19154/china-decides-iphones-pose-a-national-security-risk</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403667\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403667</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8bcbafcfa7b01b66","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"WallPanel: Android App for Web Based Dashboards and Home Automation Platforms","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:36:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:36:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5964,"y":5564,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://wallpanel.app/\">https://wallpanel.app/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403664\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403664</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"9836c476207d4905","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Tracking Finances with Spreadsheets","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:33:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:33:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4944,"y":3124,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://retireinprogress.com/how-i-track-my-finances-using-spreadsheets-part-1-why-and-what/\">https://retireinprogress.com/how-i-track-my-finances-using-spreadsheets-part-1-why-and-what/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403636\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403636</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"49cd3a69c3167df3","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Oslo district court rules Meta is violating the right to privacy (Norwegian)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:33:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:33:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6552,"y":4460,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nrkbeta.no/2023/09/06/datatilsynet-vant-frem-i-oslo-tingrett-mot-meta/\">https://nrkbeta.no/2023/09/06/datatilsynet-vant-frem-i-oslo-tingrett-mot-meta/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403633\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403633</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"18cc5c177859fca4","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Bloom Filters and Beyond: An Illustrated Introduction and Implementation","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:30:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:30:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3452,"y":4516,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/bloom-filters-and-beyond\">https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/bloom-filters-and-beyond</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403623\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403623</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"d3b8b2b590112640","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by sgarland in \"ZFS for Dummies\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:47:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:47:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3452,"y":3460,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403739\n<hr>\n<p>They mention tuning io_capacity and io_capacity_max, which unfortunately the MySQL docs indicate is useful until you click through to see what the parameters do [0].

I can read a novel for like 6 hours straight, barely even blinking, or play a video game or get lost in some programming puzzle, for that long too.  This was long pointed out (both by myself, and others) as rather clear and obvious evidence that I don't have ADHD.<p>But I cannot stand still long enough to wash the dishes.  My mind is very much elsewhere.  I will start turning the water off to just go do something else that pops into my mind.  I'll catch myself and re-start.  There will be multiple false starts like this in 15 minutes.  I eventually do just wander off.<p>The same thing will happen if you ask me to read something that doesn't grab my attention.  Tasks I've been assigned, either by myself or by others.  The same thing happens sometimes when I sit down to do something I want to do.  Often, my favourite games are unplayable, my mind is elsewhere.  I start to squirm, physically, it's very uncomfortable to continue to do a particular task even though it's trivial and I have nothing better to do, really, and even if it is sometimes enjoyable.  I will walk away in mid-conversation with people, because something popped into my mind.<p>To some degree, that's normal.  The degree I experience it is not, in proportion to my other executive functioning.   I am told this presentation/combination of symptoms/behaviours is rather common in inattentive-dominant ADHD.  Unless something is sufficiently stimulating, my brain discards it from focus very aggressively, and I'm driven to move on to something \"more important\", i.e. more stimulating/soothing to me.  That relative difficulty in marshalling attention voluntarily in that way, towards what needs to be done, rather than whatever random thing it falls on, that's ADHD.</p>"},{"id":"ad22499aee15bc8","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by specialist in \"Remembering Doug Lenat (1950–2023) and His Quest to Capture the World with Logic\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:45:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 11:45:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":450,"y":3360,"wires":[["420d3ba0937e548a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403723\n<hr>\n<p>Heh.<p>I was more hoping OpenAI would incorporate inference engines to cure ChatGPT's \"hallucinations\".

Would these be \"single instructions\" or multiple?  Then when you really break it down, many concepts are used grammatically but are not required based on their context.  Should you count that as extraneous or not?  An example is that some languages use a case system to indicate the epistemology of a statement, how the speaker knew that information (i.e. saw it first hand, heard it second hand, or saw evidence of it).

This is CL and we’re building PipeRider[0]. PipeRider is an open source data impact analysis tool, specifically during pull requests for dbt.<p>Why? In a previous life I worked on distributed version control systems[1] prior to git, weird data systems like in-postgres REST server with plv8, and building civic tech communities with open data. It always startled me when some new characteristics of data were uncovered, and we had to change some data schema & modeling and then recheck all downstream uses of the data (if we even could).<p>Fast forward to the modern era of data systems, the data engineering stack is certainly becoming more like the software engineering stack, with dbt as of one of the main game changers. But the engineering practices and tooling~~s~~ aren’t quite there, yet.<p>We are building the missing pieces of the “data-pipeline-as-code” puzzle, by making pull-requests on data systems more informative and bringing confidence to reviewing and testing the impact of code-change. Here’s an example PR of the campaign finance project[2]. The goal is to augment the CI process to help teams move faster when making data and pipeline logic changes, by being aware of intentional and unintentional downstream models and metrics impact.<p>As a version control nerd, I personally love semantic-aware diffs that can help inform stakeholders, such as diff formatted law amendment proposals in congressional bills. So, what can we do for complex data systems that are now pull-request-able? One thing is the \"lineage diff\" - A way to visualize the data models you are adding or making changes to, and help you to make sense of the impact.<p>Here's another example based on a pull request in the Danish Parliament data[3] dbt project[4] (Note the lineage diff is part of advanced impact analysis which is not open source)<p>You can try out Lineage Diff in this online viewer[5], by uploading two manifests from your dbt project to see the impact on lineage from your code-changes.<p>I’d love your feedback!<p>[0] <a href=\"https://piperider.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://piperider.io/</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32668334\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32668334</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/g0v/tw_campaign_finance/pull/2\">https://github.com/g0v/tw_campaign_finance/pull/2</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://github.com/bgarcevic/danish-democracy-data/pull/8\">https://github.com/bgarcevic/danish-democracy-data/pull/8</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://cloud.piperider.io/clkao/default/runs/33a74e0bef5f4819a74df2c9ce1135ca/comparison/fa9271ff293149fa8e401d0c78598358#/?g_v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://cloud.piperider.io/clkao/default/runs/33a74e0bef5f48...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https://cloud.piperider.io/online-viewer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://cloud.piperider.io/online-viewer</a><p>(Edit: link formatting)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403960\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403960</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"64a212e78bd8152b","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Concurrency control in an event loop, by Varda and Robinson","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:14:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:14:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7068,"y":3964,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17370663\">https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17370663</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403956\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403956</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"8b3f38e763f7877b","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Billion-scale vector search with Vespa – part one (2021)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:14:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:14:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5244,"y":3684,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn/\">https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403951\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403951</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"1b08f9f33d8bfce3","type":"subflow:50f60707302cee71","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"Ask HN: What Hidden Gems in the Science and Tech World You Might Be Missing?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:13:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:13:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5884,"y":5340,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>In the fast-paced world of technology and science, it's easy to get caught up in the buzz of mainstream advancements.

food -> feel sated is off.<p>This isn't something that's wrong with fat people, it's something wrong with the food environment they're in. 75 years ago your idea would have some intrinsic plausibility, as only a very small number of people had obesity. Now, in the United States, we're at a point where ~40% of adults have obesity. The explanation almost certainly lies with changes in the food environment, instead of with a huge portion of people catching an unknown disease that causes them to not know how much they're eating.<p>That's because in fact we <i>do</i> know about changes to food environment that could cause this. Since roughly the 1970s we've switched to foods that are more calorie-dense and less nutritious because they have become cheaper to produce. The relative cost of soft drinks and other sugary goods has increased <i>much</i> less than the cost of fresh vegetables, and in fact the industry has higher profits on these foods. I bought two liters of sugary soda for $1 the other day, that's a common offer at a grocery store near me.<p>If you drill down to how this is being accomplished, you'll notice that the rates of corn and soy production per person have vastly increased over the last 50 years. That's not because people are eating more tofu (which would be healthy), it's because (a) they're both used as additives or sweeteners (corn syrup), and (b) they're used as feed for animals who get turned into cheap meat at fast food restaurants. In fact, the US heavily subsidizes these crops - in fact they make up close to half of US farm land. As a result, the same (genetic) individual would almost certainly experience a much worse food environment today than in 1960.<p>People who aren't affected by this are those who are either (a) genetically blessed, and would hardly gain weight in any environment, or (b) are socially blessed, in that they are wealthier, live in places with a strong culture of exercise, and/or have easy access to nutritious fresh vegetables.</p>"},{"id":"4639f2a481e4e861","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by thedangler in \"Ask HN: Looking for an Alternative to Stripe\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:27:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:27:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6392,"y":5068,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404083\n<hr>\n<p>Setup a merchant account and a gateway that suits your needs for fraud detection and 3DS support.\nDepending on volume it will be cheaper then Strip.</p>"},{"id":"ad2a15ae84f937c4","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by ClumsyPilot in \"Ask HN: I’m an FCC Commissioner proposing regulation of IoT security updates\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2230,"y":2680,"wires":[["8a74983d7ef44120"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404082\n<hr>\n<p>Okay, let look at the reverse situation<p>If my ISP charges me for 100 mbps but provides 10, can I enact punishment without government interfering and protecting ISP from my punishment?</p>"},{"id":"8de239f2b5bd9f72","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by euroderf in \"Diamond prices are in free fall in one key corner of the market\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3452,"y":6012,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404081\n<hr>\n<p>As recently as a century ago, other stones like emeralds also functioned as engagement/wedding stones.</p>"},{"id":"ad040e0a5ea2e4e1","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by 93po in \"How would you say “She said goodbye too many times before.” in Latin?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":400,"y":1480,"wires":[["6d8b27129d4be497","ce4f68fa093bd747"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404080\n<hr>\n<p>> the complexities on practice are insurmountable.<p>“Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra” begs to differ</p>"},{"id":"e15073583417257b","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by Tangurena2 in \"The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6980,"y":5068,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404079\n<hr>\n<p>Also, they don't own a suitable truck, nor own the suitable tools.

He died a few days ago on August 31st.<p>I'm old enough to have lived thru the hope but ultimate failure of Lenat's baby CYC. The CYC project was initiated in 1984, in the heyday of expert systems which had been successful in many domains. The idea of an expert system was to capture the knowledge and reasoning power of a subject matter expert in a system of declarative logic and rules.<p>CYC was going to be the ultimate expert system that captured human common sense knowledge about the world via a MASSIVE knowledge/rule set (initially estimated as a 1000 man-year project) of how everyday objects behaved. The hope was that through sheer scale and completeness it would be able to reason about the world in the same way as a human who had gained the same knowledge thru embodiment and interaction.<p>The CYC project continued for decades with a massive team of people encoding rules according to it's own complex ontology, but ultimately never met it's goals. In retrospect it seems the idea was doomed to failure from the beginning, but nonetheless it was an important project that needed to be tried. The problem with any expert system reasoning over a fixed knowledge set is that it's always going to be \"brittle\" - it may perform well for cases wholly within what it knows about, but then fail when asked to reason about things where common sense knowledge and associated extrapolation of behavior is required; CYC was hoping to avoid this via scale to be so complete that there were no important knowledge gaps.<p>I have to wonder if LLM-based \"AI's\" like GPT-4 aren't in some ways very similar to CYC in that they are ultimately also giant expert systems, but with the twist that they learnt their knowledge, rules and representations/reasoning mechanisms from a training set rather than it having to be laboriously hand entered. The end result is much he same though - an ultimately brittle system who's Achille's heel is that it is based on a fixed set of knowledge rather than being able to learn from it's own mistakes and interact with the domain it is attempting to gain knowledge over. It seems there's a similar hope to CYC of scaling these LLM's up to the point that they know everything and the brittleness disappears, but I suspect that ultimately that will prove a false hope and real AI's will need to learn through experimentation just as we do.<p>RIP Doug Lenat. A pioneer of the computer age and of artificial intelligence.</p>"},{"id":"39ba74ca33f75c2f","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by seer in \"How would you say “She said goodbye too many times before.” in Latin?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:46:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:46:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":400,"y":2080,"wires":[["6d8b27129d4be497","ce4f68fa093bd747"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404322\n<hr>\n<p>While some languages “compress” information into less syllables, sometimes redundancy can be a feature.

being mentally ill in some way that prevents them to make the right choice.<p>so to me it appears that homeless students are a distinctly american problem. one that the communities and government

From night markets to side street hole-in-the-wall restaurants, more than likely the produce and meats being served were purchased that day from the market.<p>Even the foods that have a processed component often tend to be made by hand, on site, and day-of.  Buy scallion pancakes from a street vendor?  Very likely that the proprietor purchased the scallions from a market in the morning and made the dough that day.  Those scallions came from a farm harvested that day or the day before.<p>I think part of this is due to lack of density in the US and the supply chain challenges of moving fresh produce across the vastness of the US.  Another part of this is how consolidated the food supply chain is in the US (Sysco, Conagra, etc.).  Yet another part of it is the US car culture that affects our dining culture.<p>Not sure how to fix it, but I thought it was an interesting observation.</p>"},{"id":"4c1ec3c5222153d9","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by open-source-ux in \"Big effort needed on UK diet to fight ultra-processed food, say health experts\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:37:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:37:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1710,"y":4896,"wires":[["d0362a1a2ac0c716"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404924\n<hr>\n<p>For comparison: the consumption of ultra-processed food in selected European countries were from 2018 [1]<p>Top European countries with the <i>most household purchases of ultra-processed food</i>:<p>1.

Or it might preserve the feel and the flavor of the original work, but skim over a lot of the details. A really good translation captures more of both, with fewer trade-offs.<p>Jorge Luis Borges encouraged his translators to <i>improve</i> upon his original work, if possible. He worked extensively with Di Giovanni, one of his translators, debating the best way to capture certain phrases in English: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@michael.marcus/dear-mr-borges-which-translation-should-i-read-c132acf994ac\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://medium.com/@michael.marcus/dear-mr-borges-which-tran...</a> His preference was almost always to capture the \"feel\" of the work, rather than a strictly literal translation.<p>I have an odd book, which contains three copies of a story: An original in English, a French translation, and then a translation <i>back</i> into English by a new translator. The French version definitely loses something, and the second English version loses a bit more.

If a company has acknowledged you as a researcher beforehand, then you have a pretty strong legal defense if they decide later that they don't like what you find.<p>I am not suggesting a new world order over everyone that uses the internet. People who stumble upon vulnerabilities without looking for them, or through incredibly basic means like a port scan, can be protected. We can feasibly list enough ways someone can uncover a security hole without a direct effort to do so such that the spirit of the law is sufficiently obvious to any judge to include any new ways that pop up on a case by case basis.<p>However, we cannot currently offer any protection to people directly trying to find vulnerabilities when such actions are identical to people who are trying to abuse it. The only possible differentiating action would be someone to announce beforehand that they are aware what they are doing looks like criminal activity and to request permission to proceed.<p>The argument that we have the technology to make in infeasible to hack systems is moot and imo naive. There is cost, significant cost, to maintaining the highest level of cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity experts are some of the highest paid IT professionals on the market right now.<p>So I do not see how educating people who want to look for vulnerabilities to reach out for approval on what they are doing is too much order, but requiring everyone who creates anything that uses the internet to successfully implement state of the art cybersecurity defenses is not</p>"},{"id":"1685e6d31fe59f64","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by pard68 in \"If You’ve Got a New Car, It’s a Data Privacy Nightmare\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1890,"y":4340,"wires":[["85721b4d0ae17094"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37405006\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"8bd13885cad51b8b","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by alwaysrunning in \"If You’ve Got a New Car, It’s a Data Privacy Nightmare\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1890,"y":4380,"wires":[["85721b4d0ae17094"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37405005\n<hr>\n<p>Where is the host file so I can block all this data from being uploaded?</p>"},{"id":"26e202becb066848","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by BLKNSLVR in \"Hottest summer on record by a significant margin\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5964,"y":5676,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37405004\n<hr>\n<p>Scroll to the end:\n<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1732/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://xkcd.com/1732/</a></p>"},{"id":"6aaaed428963fa36","type":"subflow:fe404921dc2910b9","z":"6b1866eb8223a125","name":"New comment by swarnie in \"Big effort needed on UK diet to fight ultra-processed food, say health experts\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:42:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1710,"y":4936,"wires":[["d0362a1a2ac0c716"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37405003\n<hr>\n<p>I'd go simpler than that.
