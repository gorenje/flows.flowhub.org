[{"id":"611c047e656989ae","type":"tab","label":"Overflow","disabled":false,"info":"An overview flow of all flows, an *overflow*.\n\nAt the very <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"c12ccdc11d02fb1f\">core of FlowHub</a> is visual programming: the visual representation of machine-exectuable code.\n\nAn exploration of what is possible, an exploration of [visual programming compared to textual programming](https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/visual-programming-and-ai). Bring textual wisdoms to a visual world: [refactoring](https://flowhub.org/f/0e07ddb58be5f031), [design patterns](https://flowhub.org/f/600b912208e31e75) or [text 2 visual examples](https://flowhub.org/f/91197129247b83b8). More fundamentally exploring what <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='71fa650e4ea36877'>*is* a flow</a>? Flows can have different meanings [*yet* have a similar styles](https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/pipes-wires-nodes). Can a [mindmap](https://flowhub.org/f/e642c9a2598507ed) executable code? Using Node-RED I can create a mindmap structure, should that be allowed?\n\n[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is the tool of choice for this exploration and <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"a149c10c4103dfa1\">learning</a> is the first step. The [Hello World flow](https://flowhub.org/f/7bac2d969ad2969f) presents the core notions of (most) visual programming: the wire and the node, line and rectangle in a geometric context. Sometimes its simpler to think of lines and rectangles, so as to *see* the code.\n\nHaving the grasp the basics, one falls <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"20c0fbf8ee715ac8\">into the pitholes</a> of Node-RED. Avoiding them can be helpful but also reflective. Why have certain design decisions been made in Node-RED? Why is a [switch not a switch](https://flowhub.org/f/ea246f68766c8630)? How empty is [empty](https://flowhub.org/f/431fa52279b0d11b)? \n\nHaving climbed out of the pitfalls, what then? Every good language should be used to build a blog! [FlowHub for example](https://backup.flowhub.org/?flid=d10d5f55f1bb5923&v2=036a5afb4e59f2c20b523db238b6db6f9668b4d7&v1=67f93017975b77e461994278f9f580c89b2b63ba). For that <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"cac19791d3a6e84c\">web framework</a> has to be built, why not? [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) was constructed on top of [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) - a telecommunications language. Storage for a blog is important, why not <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"1bfe6f6686e20790\">GitHub</a>?\n\nBut Node-RED can also drive <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"e0cd96174746390f\">LED tickers</a>. It started with a [simulation](https://flowhub.org/f/18a539afac758c61) of a ticker and ended with a [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/) defined [API](https://flowhub.org/f/49221ed0e76e27c3) for an [I^2^C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) driven [LED panel](https://flowhub.org/f/be2109bba90b6c5a). What started as a joke ended in a learning on how to drive an I^2^C bus in Node-RED. In a similar vain, from an idea came <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"6169409cc1345f1d\">Open Street Map</a> usage. Where are the closest warmest [place around a center point](https://flowhub.org/f/4f3f93dc29d0f1f1)? \n\nIn creating FlowHub.org, the question arose what should its purpose be? I use it also to <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"c489d5c04b95a816\">document introspection</a> tools that are available as Node-RED [plugins](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@gregoriusrippenstein/node-red-contrib-introspection). Introspection tools helped me to learn the inside workings of Node-RED, particularly how the editor is built and understanding of the client-server communication.\n\nThe <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"8db026d0e5ee5f93\">rest</a> is a collection of unclassifiable ideas. How to do an [OAuth2 flow](https://flowhub.org/f/fafd7c807c192d4a). How does [JMap](https://flowhub.org/f/90196166b57a77e5) work in Node-RED. Creating a RSS feed of [Hacker News readers](https://flowhub.org/f/a8d90fc15ab6990b) - which also demonstrates an approach to caching in Node-RED.\n\nIn the end there is no single *one* reason for using Node-RED, Node-RED is basically a visual programming frontend to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about) and anything one can do in NodeJS can be done in Node-RED.\n","env":[]},{"id":"c489d5c04b95a816","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Introspection Node collection -
