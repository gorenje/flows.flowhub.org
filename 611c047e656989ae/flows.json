Finding a representation of textual wisdoms in a visual world: [refactoring](https://flowhub.org/f/0e07ddb58be5f031), [design patterns](https://flowhub.org/f/600b912208e31e75) or [a visual comparison](https://flowhub.org/f/91197129247b83b8). More fundamentally exploring what <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='71fa650e4ea36877'>*is* a flow</a>? Flows can have different interpretations [*but* the same looks](https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/pipes-wires-nodes) or [meaning](https://flowhub.org/f/42e964ad34851488) or is a [mindmap](https://flowhub.org/f/e642c9a2598507ed) executable code?.\n\n[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is the tool of choice for this exploration and <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"a149c10c4103dfa1\">learning</a> it is the first step. The [Hello World flow](https://flowhub.org/f/7bac2d969ad2969f) demonstrates the basic notions of (most) visual programming: wire and node, line and rectangle in a geometric context. Sometimes its simpler to think of lines and rectangles, to *see* the code.\n\nHaving the grasp the basics, one falls <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"a149c10c4103dfa1\">into the pitholes</a> of Node-RED. Avoiding them can be helpful but also reflective. Why have certain design decisions been made in Node-RED? Why is a [switch not a switch](https://flowhub.org/f/ea246f68766c8630)? How empty is [empty](https://flowhub.org/f/431fa52279b0d11b)? \n\n\n\n","env":[]},{"id":"c489d5c04b95a816","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Introspection Node collection - explanatory flows","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["8c1ba09305b78069","4aa909673f04380f","154e1ed624df7cfd","c5fdc93ada5ac021","e88276227992e7d6","468449441d0c944e","60c73f2e7ca80c05"],"x":81.607177734375,"y":1436.5499267578125,"w":432,"h":355.3304443359375},{"id":"e0cd96174746390f","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"LED Ticker Display","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["8bea3f4a02c8b681","a06e9ce5b62a40f8","9d6a57f83de42ed5","4d8460df27767ea5"],"x":107.2078857421875,"y":1869.03271484375,"w":601.0625,"h":224.60546875},{"id":"1bfe6f6686e20790","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"GitHub as storage/cdn","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["7a1f37301a0d38f8","21b9371d16a85ed0","cf6709bcbc6aac3e","3bc29cd6c38eea69"],"x":1384.062255859375,"y":1856.0731201171875,"w":312,"h":216.2847900390625},{"id":"20c0fbf8ee715ac8","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Having learnt Node-RED, some A-ha-Moments","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["d2bb828bae6cfbbd","6570c6289036680b","f3e661f39d5dd2cf","de75595a3f3aa506"],"x":958.599365234375,"y":1231.5389404296875,"w":552,"h":194.27099609375},{"id":"a149c10c4103dfa1","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Learning Node-RED","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["0b4d39ecd5d3d964","7233827b78339281","38855318c1c536f3","a650b2a1b276e5d5","d991fa8b352ac848"],"x":578.184814453125,"y":1261.1448974609375,"w":332,"h":265.6915283203125},{"id":"6169409cc1345f1d","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Open Street Map & Wikipedia integration","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["16024e96a2b46288","a8e4f0e9843174d8","13b04d6c3409b108"],"x":1384.9058837890625,"y":1464.2001953125,"w":292,"h":167.1494140625},{"id":"cac19791d3a6e84c","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Creating a Web framework with Node-RED","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["a5ed66d1c9ef56d0","0ad2a545a805e3ef","efc9bfd218528277"],"x":1655.7706894016035,"y":1652.6001822174394,"w":292,"h":172.0545654296875},{"id":"71fa650e4ea36877","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"c12ccdc11d02fb1f","name":"What are Flows?","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["1012ce8f4d6a6a26","54bc1dd077762f95"],"x":911.355712890625,"y":1770.5498046875,"w":332,"h":135.120361328125},{"id":"c12ccdc11d02fb1f","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Visual Programming - future or fail?","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["e3ae856e4c8f1bf0","c32051d1733d1f4f","14a1e45b61bcf84b","71fa650e4ea36877"],"x":885.355712890625,"y":1585.990478515625,"w":384,"h":345.6796875},{"id":"8db026d0e5ee5f93","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"The Rest.","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["583672f474ac100c","4f62b4777c503546","f35c7b4dbd3040f5","1523826e8261b41d","df02d17063b95699","9268acabd597a828","123ef95ffc1c1daf"],"x":503.34698486328125,"y":2148.4208984375,"w":1142.9815063476562,"h":212.004150390625},{"id":"0b4d39ecd5d3d964","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"a149c10c4103dfa1","name":"Hello World - part 1: Input & Output","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/7bac2d969ad2969f","x":744.184814453125,"y":1302.1448974609375,"wires":[]},{"id":"7233827b78339281","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"a149c10c4103dfa1","name":"Hello World - part 2: Functionality","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/2817a602bd1ba715","x":734.184814453125,"y":1348.0677795410156,"wires":[]},{"id":"38855318c1c536f3","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"a149c10c4103dfa1","name":"Hello World - part 3: Data Reuse","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/722b6181086e9abe","x":734.184814453125,"y":1393.9906616210938,"wires":[]},{"id":"a650b2a1b276e5d5","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"a149c10c4103dfa1","name":"Hello World - part 4: Function Reuse","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/67a6db53dc49ae4c","x":744.184814453125,"y":1439.9135437011719,"wires":[]},{"id":"d991fa8b352ac848","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"a149c10c4103dfa1","name":"Node-RED Introduction - part 1","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/7f8714fa6e835a2a","x":734.184814453125,"y":1485.83642578125,"wires":[]},{"id":"d2bb828bae6cfbbd","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"20c0fbf8ee715ac8","name":"Node-RED Learnings - HTTP requestTimeout","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/60871bf5eadd6d7f","x":1154.599365234375,"y":1309.9626057942708,"wires":[]},{"id":"6570c6289036680b","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"20c0fbf8ee715ac8","name":"Node-RED Learnings - Split & Join - don't drop messages","info":"https://flowhub.org/f/1cf772ae2066495e","x":1194.599365234375,"y":1272.5389404296875,"wires":[]},{"id":"f3e661f39d5dd2cf","type":"comment","z":"611c047e656989ae","g":"20c0fbf8ee715ac8","name":"Node-RED Learnings - Switch - Check all rules v.
