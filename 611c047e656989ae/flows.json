[{"id":"611c047e656989ae","type":"tab","label":"Overflow","disabled":false,"info":"At the very <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"c12ccdc11d02fb1f\">core of FlowHub</a> is visual programming: the visual representation of machine-exectuable code.\n\nAn exploration of what is possible, an exploration of [visual programming compared to textual programming](https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/visual-programming-and-ai). An attempt to bring textual wisdoms to a visual world: [refactoring](https://flowhub.org/f/0e07ddb58be5f031), [design patterns](https://flowhub.org/f/600b912208e31e75) or [text code as visual code](https://flowhub.org/f/91197129247b83b8). Flows can have different meanings [yet have the same representation](https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/pipes-wires-nodes). Can a [mindmap] be (https://flowhub.org/f/e642c9a2598507ed) executable code?\n\n <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"a149c10c4103dfa1\">Learning</a> [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is a difficult first step. The [Hello World flow](https://flowhub.org/f/7bac2d969ad2969f) presents the core notions of Node-REDs visual programming paradigm: the wire and the node, line and rectangle in a geometric context. Sometimes its simpler to think of lines and rectangles.\n\nGrasping the basics, one falls <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"20c0fbf8ee715ac8\">into the pitholes</a> of Node-RED. Avoiding them can be helpful but also reflective. Why have certain design decisions been made within Node-RED? Why is a [switch not a switch](https://flowhub.org/f/ea246f68766c8630)? How empty is [empty](https://flowhub.org/f/431fa52279b0d11b)? \n\nHaving climbed out of the pitfalls, what then? Every good language should be used to build a blog. [FlowHub for example](https://backup.flowhub.org/?flid=d10d5f55f1bb5923&v2=036a5afb4e59f2c20b523db238b6db6f9668b4d7&v1=67f93017975b77e461994278f9f580c89b2b63ba). For that <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"cac19791d3a6e84c\">web framework</a> has to be built, why not? [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) was constructed on top of [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) - a telecommunications language. Storage for a blog is important, why not <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"1bfe6f6686e20790\">GitHub</a>?\n\nBut Node-RED can also drive <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"e0cd96174746390f\">LED tickers</a>. It started with a [simulation](https://flowhub.org/f/18a539afac758c61) of a ticker and ended with a [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/) defined [API](https://flowhub.org/f/49221ed0e76e27c3) for an [I^2^C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) driven [LED panel](https://flowhub.org/f/be2109bba90b6c5a). What started as a joke ended in a learning on how to drive an I^2^C bus in Node-RED. In a similar vain, from an idea came <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"6169409cc1345f1d\">Open Street Map</a> usage. Where are the closest warmest [place around a center point](https://flowhub.org/f/4f3f93dc29d0f1f1)? \n\nIn the end there is no single *one* reason for using Node-RED, Node-RED is basically a visual programming frontend to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about) and anything NodeJS can be done, so can Node-RED.\n\n","env":[]},{"id":"c489d5c04b95a816","type":"group","z":"611c047e656989ae","name":"Introspection Node collection - explanatory
