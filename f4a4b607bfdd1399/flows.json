However it's concerning that it happened at all, as all the ips were Cloudflare ips, e.g.:<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>172.69.90.116 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>108.162.221.143 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.235.85 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.110.143 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.110.142 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.22 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>(it was around 5800 requests per second to a site that normally gets 1 request per second or less at this time of day, and lasted 21.5 minutes).<p>As it is http, I don't think it could have been spoofed. I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.<p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?<p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Two common metrics are precision and recall. Precision in the context of maps would be that everything you see is highly relevant. It's not. Random selection of crap I don't care about would be the friendliest thing to say about it. Recall would be that if it is there, you should be able to find it by zooming in. It fails hard with that too. Google maps is neither very precise or very good at recalling things. It used to be better at this.<p>Not showing the street names is a problem. Filtering out business I know exist and that I know they have is a problem. Bakeries, bars, coffee places, etc. They have them all. But not on the map. And it's not like there is a lot of other content competing for attention when fully zoomed in. I live in the middle of Berlin, not in a freaking desert.<p>Only when I search for them do they show up. Showing me nothing where I know they have stuff is a choice. A bad one. It's all form over function lately at Google. Lipstick on a pig. And it doesn't even look that good. Hating the bright greens particularly. Fugly as hell. But Apple does it so it must be good. I guess imitation is a form of flattery. Or desperation. Or something. But it's definitely imitation.<p>It indeed looks like nobody is in charge, as Ian Hickson suggested in the article that was on HN last week when he left Google after 16 years. Indecisiveness and a lack of leadership are on full display here. Nobody calling BS on this is a problem. Leadership allowing this out of the door, or worse, insisting it is released in this form, is a problem.

Unfortunately, it’s not consistently used that way in practice, which makes the situation confusing at times.</p>"},{"id":"842476485aa614d","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by tnbp in \"You don't need JavaScript for that\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:20:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:20:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6224.979023965208,"y":1590.7348907410405,"wires":[["3e92f9e5000cc957"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498101\n<hr>\n<p>Do this only if you don't care about the people that use (sometimes: have to use) your software.

Keep in mind this is a nit. It's text in bold in the page, but this is NOT an attack on anything else in the article, which describes good design practices.<p>There is no principle that one should \"Choose the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose.\"<p>This would, in fact, be an incredibly stupid principle. One want the most powerful language for any purpose. However, \"purpose\" is broadly defined:<p>1) We want code to be semantic. This allows a11y tools, search engines, and various performance optimizations to understand what's going on.<p>2) We want clean abstractions. In a horizontally-abstracted system, we would like the content designer to be focused on the content, the UX designed to be able to focus on the UX, and the back-end engineer to be focused on the back-end. (Note that, contrary to the beliefs of most people who have only worked on database-backed web applications, vertical abstractions are okay too, and break things up completely differently).<p>3) We want systems to be bug-free and understandable.<p>This can leads to programming paradigms like functional programming + React, where no mutation is allowed. This isn't a random restriction which reduces power; to the contrary, it increases power by allowing predictable state, avoiding a whole class of bugs, and allowing debugging with time travel.<p>In other words, you want good design discipline. However, the point here is much more on \"good design\" and not \"discipline.\"<p>Every one of the changes proposed can be derived from first principles from the above. But this does not come from some principle of \"least power.\"<p>To make this even simpler: Think of diet discipline. The goal isn't discipline about being hungry and eating yucky food. The point is about being healthy and losing weight. That probably involves being hungry and eating yucky food, but that's not the point. Food should be as tasty as possible and people should not be hungry to the extent goals on weight, heart health, insulin resistance, etc. can be accomplished.<p>Same thing here. Languages should be as powerful as possible, while allowing goals around readability, introspection, a11y, abstraction, etc. to be accomplished. That requires very specific and narrow constraints on what one bans.</p>"},{"id":"960439b93f9e2a45","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by deafpolygon in \"AI can tell what you're typing by listening to the sound of your keyboard\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:19:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:19:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2024.0001220703125,"y":3275.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498092\n<hr>\n<p>I guess I'm safe because I type at 100+ wpm.</p>"},{"id":"9ad37b4c5ecd6f1c","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by ephbit in \"Toyota to sell 900% more hydrogen cars than solid-state EVs\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:18:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:18:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1456.0001220703125,"y":2539.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498091\n<hr>\n<p>This exists.

The result is a platform for building and hosting full-stack web applications, entirely in Python.<p>Web development is way too complicated, especially if you're not a professional full-stack dev. So we're fixing it: Instead of writing JS/HTML/CSS/Python/SQL and all the associated frameworks, Anvil enables developers to design pages with drag-and-drop, write Python that runs in the browser and on the server, set up a database, and deploy their code instantly as a hosted service.<p><i>1. Senior Developer</i><p>We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder who's comfortable with a variety of technologies to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on back-end and systems engineering. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but the right person won’t be put off by jumping into something you haven’t used before.<p>You’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (PhDs in programming usability, kernel contributors, builders of backyard dancing fountains) and senior colleagues (a former maths teacher who went from “teaching Python to students” to “reverse-engineering Anvil’s designer to build better UI components” in months), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. It’s a small, smart, friendly and diverse team, and all of us care deeply about building interesting technology that makes life easier for other developers.<p>Building dev tools is great! We're solving problems we have ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms get the best engineering problems.<p>---<p><i>2. Developer Advocate</i><p>We’re looking for a developer with great communication skills to show people how to build awesome things with Anvil, and to make Anvil better to use.<p>You’ll be writing how-to guides, blog posts and tutorials, building example apps, presenting Anvil at conferences, and helping our users – from individual developers to huge tech companies – build their web applications. You’ll then use what you’ve learned to help us make Anvil better to use. That might mean deciding what examples to build, or it might mean deciding that we need to redesign the first-run experience for the Anvil Editor – and then doing it.<p>It's rewarding work – developers love being introduced to Anvil (we get mobbed at conferences!). Plus, there are all the advantages of an early-stage startup: seriously smart colleagues, small team, lots of autonomy, and huge impact. (Did I mention we're diverse, friendly and supportive?)<p>---<p>For full job descriptions, and to hear what it's like working here, go to <a href=\"https://anvil.works/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://anvil.works/jobs</a>.<p>If you have questions, reach out to me - I'm a founder, and my email's in my profile.</p>"},{"id":"8e3bfe1ef684c089","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by h2odragon in \"To protect kids, the EPA wants total removal of lead pipes\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:25:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:25:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2568.673893989366,"y":1829.911987427398,"wires":[["e538874c851ad6e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498127\n<hr>\n<p>We should go back to wood: <a href=\"https://www.hiddenhydrology.org/the-water-in-the-wood/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hiddenhydrology.org/the-water-in-the-wood/</a></p>"},{"id":"a6237a473852372e","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by mock-possum in \"You don't need JavaScript for that\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6224.979023965208,"y":1750.7348907410405,"wires":[["3e92f9e5000cc957"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498126\n<hr>\n<p>> *The rule of least power*<p>> It's one of the core principles of web development and it means that you should Choose the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose.<p>> On the web this means preferring HTML over CSS, and then CSS over JS.<p>Ah I totally do this, I never though to put a name to it besides taking the ‘minimal’ approach - if you can do it with just HTML, then by all means, just mark up some content and be done with it.</p>"},{"id":"2e3b357a044b2e55","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by Kuinox in \"Electrocaloric Material Makes Refrigerant-Free Solid-State Fridge Scalable\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4980,"y":684,"wires":[["b5e3fed17a674f8e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498125\n<hr>\n<p>> SSDs dies faster than spinning disks.<p>That's so wrong it's hilarious.</p>"},{"id":"2adbb904c4a7b7de","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by Alifatisk in \"Add dark mode to your website with a single line of code\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5830,"y":1470,"wires":[["d02fd425dab2e529","6538d60731cd9cde"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498124\n<hr>\n<p>> a single line of code<p>Which means importing a whole js file</p>"},{"id":"7c29150168acf3a","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by disgruntledphd2 in \"Britain's scariest libel firm\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:24:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-760.0001220703125,"y":1595.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498123\n<hr>\n<p>Amsterdam maybe but Dublin doesn't have that many connections.

Why?<p>In my career there are two types of software projects. Ones that start off using a powerful language and libraries, and those that don’t because “this is just a prototype/small project”. 9 times out of 10 the second type naturally evolves into something more complex and requirements become harder to solve with some “least powerful” language. Inevitably a costly migration is made to a more powerful toolset, be that react, Spring, or whatever.<p>I think it’s a bit different in infrastructure where the core of what you want is a declarative set of requirements and properties.

Every browser had custom behaviour and rendered pages differently. JavaScript and CSS were still new, and it took years for the implementations to be standardized. Websites had \"Best viewed in Netscape\" or \"Built for IE\" badges. Java applets, ActiveX, Flash, and a bunch of other technologies surfaced to make early versions of web \"apps\" actually possible. Even as late as 2005, projects like jQuery were needed to make web development easier.<p>I'd say that it wasn't until the late aughts, well after \"web 2.0\" that web development didn't feel hacky.<p>By then, though, the JS ecosystem exploded, and frontend frameworks took off. So I get the sentiment that modern web development is difficult, bloated and buggy, but the good news is that the web is fully mature now, and there are plenty of projects that make it possible to build simple and robust web sites. Web developers are spoiled with choice, so a hard task is simply selecting the right technologies to use. Unfortunately, sometimes this is out of our hands, or we inherit decade-old codebases that make maintenance a nightmare.</p>"},{"id":"a0d8b1712b6e2576","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by throwuwu in \"How to tackle unreliability of coding assistants\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:47:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:47:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2792.0001220703125,"y":2235.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498253\n<hr>\n<p>It’s a multi turn conversation, just workshop the idea and make changes along the way</p>"},{"id":"886d960a5760dd7f","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by bravetraveler in \"Show HN: Unofficial YouTube Wrapped 2023, see top creators and watching habits\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:47:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:47:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2792.0001220703125,"y":3899.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498252\n<hr>\n<p>I feel like the odd one out being completely uninterested in stats like this...<p>Largely for what you allude to: what else are they doing <i>(or could)</i> with this?<p>I don't know.

Once every while there's an incident, and a story such as this comes out.<p>This is sort of the nature of an industry that doesn't shut down regularly, and must be manned. Planes fly, and someone must direct them, at all times.<p>I work in rail, and it's the same story. A number of us who control trains and train traffic work long hours every day of the week, because someone _must_ be there. You can't just, at the end of eight hours say \"time to go home,\" if the next person doesn't show. That \"next person\" is now you. This is how it works in _any_ full time operation.<p>All parties take advantage. While I can not speak for Air Traffic Control, my job, as many American Industries, have realized the benefit of having too few people. Few employees means lower costs in many cases, for example here's the first search hit on helping an employer figure it out [1]. With ever rising costs, some employees are more than willing to work overtime to make ends meet. So, the employer saves costs by hiring fewer people and relying on those who want to make overtime.<p>The problem is that neither side knows \"when to quit,\" and the cycle continues to feed itself.

Definitely not some server running on the cloud which you can't see except for logs.<p>For the LLM to learn MOST from humans, it needs to operate on systems where humans can provide PROPER feedback. \nWhat are the examples of this? the systems we using RIGHT NOW.<p>I picked MacOS.<p>Lets deep dive into how I see it.<p>I called it LLM extended OS<p>First, it has A LOT in common with what \n@karpathy\n has shown\nIt has access to terminal, camera, audio, and browsing.<p>The main difference is that it has APPS people use right now. Like:\n- VS Code\n- Finder\n- TODO lists<p>Just think about it. \nIf LLM has imperfect attention. Just like humans do, why not give it a FULL interface WE use including not only\n- Calendar – allow LLM to schedule tasks\n- Reminders – set tasks it NEEDS to do\n- Music – no, just kidding\n- Discord – allow it to EFFICIENTLY communicate with OTHER LLMS, and send them tasks while being ignored if they are not interested<p>Another major difference is Graphical user interface (GUI).<p>Yes, VISION is too powerful to NOT make use of it. \n@josh_bickett\n just made a great case with self self-operating computer. Which proves the point.<p>One thing I think EVERYONE has missed is something that has been lying here for decades.<p>Accessibility/VoiceOver<p>Some people have trouble SEEING stuff. Thanks to apple, those people can STILL use the computer just like YOU DO. Which is mind-blowing right?<p>And think about it, visually impaired people can navigate the computer and almost FULLY operate just like you can. I tried it, its pure magic.<p>The question is, \nif those people use only, RAW PRONOUNCED TEXT to navigate, will LLM not be able to do it?<p>You know the answer<p>And there is more to write about it... I'll keep the progress update here \nX: @Karmedge<p>Let me know what you think<p>I would appreciate any feedback on this concept and potentially wrong assumptions I made, feel free to correct me.<p>The winner in this race must be humanity, not capitalism.<p>Thoughts/</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498414\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498414</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"359af2b4a46f84a3","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"LLMs and the Extended Mind Thesis","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:09:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:09:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3623.6746719340304,"y":3197.5883444895553,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.georgovassilis.com/2023/11/29/llms-and-the-extended-mind-thesis/\">https://blog.georgovassilis.com/2023/11/29/llms-and-the-extended-mind-thesis/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498368\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498368</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"5473288251114098","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"The Enduring Strangeness of Nicolas Cage","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:08:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:08:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4371.883541886666,"y":1856.8385143884093,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/assessment/the-enduring-strangeness-of-nicolas-cage\">https://www.newyorker.com/culture/assessment/the-enduring-strangeness-of-nicolas-cage</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498361\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498361</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"f9b1f67c51b74599","type":"subflow:ad15b7e6fa081c83","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Chrome's next weapon in the War on Ad Blockers: Slower extension updates","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 03:17:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 03:17:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3483.171478904086,"y":1341.6793471570554,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/12/chromes-next-weapon-in-the-war-on-ad-blockers-slower-extension-updates/\">https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/12/chromes-next-weapon-in-the-war-on-ad-blockers-slower-extension-updates/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38495559\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38495559</a></p>\n<p>Points: 144</p>\n<p># Comments: 106</p>"},{"id":"c0ad292c27ed63e9","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by JonnyLifschutz in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

Hearing loss is usually caused by damage and death of the hair cells——the sensory receptor cells that respond directly to sound. The hairs wiggle and open channels that flux ions across the hair cell membrane. This in turn causes these cell to releases neurotransmitters the induce action potentials (spikes) in the axons of spiral ganglion cell.<p>2. But hearing loss can also be caused by damage to the spiral ganglion cells themselves. These cells and their axons conduct spikes between cochlea and brain.<p>Basically, two mechanisms that contribute to hearing loss and tinnitus.<p>In the same way, blindness can also be caused by two major classes of cell loss—-1. the loss of photoreceptors (called retinal degeneration) or 2. by loss of axons in the optic nerve (retinal ganglion cell axons) and usually called glaucoma.<p>This lively study is focused on the consequences of hearing loss caused primarily by damage to the cochlear nerve fibers and their synapses in the cochlea, not the degeneration of hair cells per se. It is a great and  systematic study that support the idea that tinnitus can in some cases (many) be associated with nerve damage rather than hair cell loss.<p>If you want a good introduction to this work then read this review article by the same group.<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438769/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438769/</a></p>"},{"id":"ac438f8b038b3f18","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by phferreira in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

Also, it works way smoother without finicky VSync and other small paper cuts.<p>Current, modern amdgpu driver supports cards which are 10 years old at this point. radeon kernel module supports cards even older than that, and this module is still updated, tuned up and fixed.<p>So, while AMD was the underdog, they managed to redesign their chips and restart a community and an independent department to develop and support open source drivers only.<p>I think NVIDIA can do that, too, if they can be bothered, but alas, they don't care.</p>"},{"id":"5e7b8c7a2058dd52","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by SideburnsOfDoom in \"To protect kids, the EPA wants total removal of lead pipes\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:34:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:34:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2568.673893989366,"y":2681.911987427398,"wires":[["e538874c851ad6e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498513\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"a051cbc710b739e7","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by verisimi in \"A medieval Gothic monastery built using CAD / CAM\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:34:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:34:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2580,"y":4392,"wires":[["7b8e9cc8fea20710"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498512\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks.<p>From their about page - <a href=\"https://www.mysticmonkcoffee.com/pages/about-us-wyoming-carmelites\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mysticmonkcoffee.com/pages/about-us-wyoming-carm...</a>:<p>> From their monastery nestled deep in the Rocky Mountains, the Wyoming Carmelites (a small group of Carmelite Monks) ­were looking for a way to support their growing community.<p>> After much discernment and prayer, the monks had the inspiration to start roasting coffee and selling the beans online.
