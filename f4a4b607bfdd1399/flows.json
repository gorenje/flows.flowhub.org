thread a bit earlier this year.<p>Last year we had an incredible response to a thread offering assistance to those in the HN community. You can read it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34122118<p>Last year we were able to provide nearly $20k worth of support to community members. I know things have only gotten more challenging since then for a number of us, so I wanted to make sure I provided more time this year for people to reach out.<p>As usual, this is not a request for donations. Last year and this year I am content to finance this operation myself (although a number of people did step up and offer additional support). All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.<p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds. Reasonable requests include:<p>- Holiday housing<p>- Toys/gifts for family members<p>- Food<p>- Travel assistance<p>- Medical expenses<p>- Entertainment for the family<p>I understand, as a formerly homeless person myself, that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us.<p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.<p>Happy holidays!<p>- Alexander</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Account to make service changes (plus getting a hold of support is difficult, which is good in this context). However, I'm trying to move away from Google services and want to use Fastmail on iOS instead of Gmail on Android, but Google Fi requires the use of a Google account (e.g. for the Fi app, which provides critical functionality IIUC).<p>So to make a long-story short, I'm looking for another wireless carrier, but I'm concerned about SIM-swapping attacks (I know, I shouldn't be using SMS-based 2FA, but many services fallback to it and don't allow this to be disabled).<p>So, which carriers offer some kind of protection against SIM swapping, ideally something more than a 4-digit PIN that's texted to you (looking at you Mint)? During my research, I found https://www.efani.com/, but this seems like overkill for a non-high profile person.<p>I'm based in the US.<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496304\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496304</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"b2fde2a3870250de","type":"subflow:ad15b7e6fa081c83","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Insanity of Modern Automotive Electronics Will Lead to a Mechanical Revolution [video]","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 03:14:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 03:14:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5055.0880370271925,"y":4963.966092308415,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANxhQ4wUiMQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANxhQ4wUiMQ</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38495542\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38495542</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 36</p>"},{"id":"99843d87d67d61f","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Show HN: Browser based Image Editor with AI","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:57:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:57:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2939.9998779296875,"y":1019.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/smyja/Mirage\">https://github.com/smyja/Mirage</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497166\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497166</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"c86605cbf5a8f543","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Advent of Code: scaling adventures (2020)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3923.9998779296875,"y":971.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"dbb98b3d3bd56bfe","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"OpenAI's GPT store delayed to next year","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2183.9998779296875,"y":971.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984497/openai-gpt-store-delayed-ai-gpt\">https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984497/openai-gpt-store-delayed-ai-gpt</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"88713a9149995bd6","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"This week in KDE: changing the wallpaper from within System Settings","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3199.9998779296875,"y":1403.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://pointieststick.com/2023/12/01/this-week-in-kde-changing-the-wallpaper-from-within-system-settings/\">https://pointieststick.com/2023/12/01/this-week-in-kde-changing-the-wallpaper-from-within-system-settings/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497228\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497228</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5e58fd1cb469d372","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"The fastest biotech to go to in-human trials","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2183.9998779296875,"y":1019.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://mxschons.com/2023/alvea-case-study-of-the-fastest-biotech-to-go-to-in-human-trials-5-6-drug-development-series/\">https://mxschons.com/2023/alvea-case-study-of-the-fastest-biotech-to-go-to-in-human-trials-5-6-drug-development-series/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497227\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497227</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8e20318da781070b","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"JavaScript WTF: Why does every() return true for empty arrays?

Instead of saying \"Baby Peter is adult Peter\" (BP = AP) we can say \"Baby Peter will become adult Peter\" (BP < AP) or \"Adult Peter was Baby Peter\" (AP > BP). Unlike =, < and > are not equivalence relations. They are transitive, but they are neither reflexive nor symmetric. This way branching persons (forks or fusions) do not lead to paradoxes. If X branches into Y and Z, it is perfectly possible that X < Y, X < Z, and Y ≠ Z. The person that is about to enter the duplicator (X) <i>becomes</i>, one moment later, both the person that comes out on the left (Y) and the person that comes out on the right (Z). That doesn't mean that Y and Z are the same person, they just both <i>have been</i> X a moment ago.<p>This means that when we go to bed in the evening, there is a different person that comes out of the bed in the morning. But that's not so counterintuitive, since the evening person still <i>became</i> the morning person.<p>This weaker relation of \"becoming\" (rather than the stronger relation of \"being identical to\") can also serve as the notion of \"survival\".

I say \"approximately\" but I'm pretty sure the percentage of people <i>not</i> doing this is a rounding error we can ignore. Anyway, all the major IDE's, so far as I know, can import a Maven or Gradle project and work with it. So if you setup your project to use Maven or Gradle, you can share it around and anybody using any IDE (or no IDE) can work with it. Now there will still be (usually anyway) some IDE specific files that get created when you import the project into Netbeans, Eclipse, whatever. But those you can just mention in .gitignore and choose not to distribute with your project.<p>Not sure how all the various IDE's handle working with things like Make or Cmake for environments building with those tools, but I expect a similar pattern probably holds to a large extent.

The only reason for using a class here is more as a general principle if you want it to be easier to pass your \"usercreator\" around as a value, but you can of course wrap it in a lambda if needed or use `#method`. Alternatively you can just make it a lambda from the start. If your main objection to the class is the ease of breaking encapsulation, lambda's are quite nice for tighter encapsulation of state in Ruby.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>     lambda do\n       state = 0\n       ->() { state += 1 }\n     end.call\n</code></pre>\n(Note the `.call` at the end - we don't want the outer lambda; that is just used for creating the variables that will hold the state - we want the inner lambda)<p>So let's say that for some stupid reason your user creator object needs to keep a count of users, you could \"seal\" that state into a lambda with the above technique, and make it really hard (I'm not sure if <i>impossible</i>) to break encapsulation. E.g. instance_eval or trying obtain the binding doesn't work, because they both will get you the state of the Proc object containing the closure, not the local variables accessible within it.</p>"},{"id":"9aae5e97337d4425","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by CR007 in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

Yet. Maybe it will in the future, then DRY it up <i>then</i>.  Secondly, DRY is meaningless if applied at units so small that you replace one invocation of a method with another invocation of a method when the arguments to the first one are obvious. E.g. consider this from the example:<p><pre><code>    def find_admin_role\n        Roles.find_by(name: 'admin')\n    end\n</code></pre>\nAssuming your application consistently uses `name`, and is consistent about class names, `find_admin_role` is not saving you complexity over Roles.find_by(name: 'admin'). People familiar with Ruby ORMs and tasked with finding an admin role will go looking for finders in the Role class. They're not likely to find your method, and so are likely to write their own.<p>The former introduces complexity that is <i>only warranted</i> to me if 1) the method of finding the admin role grows more complex so it's non-obvious, 2) the method you DRY it up into is actually being used at least twice, 3) it's placed in the most appropriate class.<p>And it's that second where YAGNI comes in. By all means, DRY up logic. But don't do it before it <i>actually</i> stops you repeating yourself in a way that is actually significant.<p>To #3, that \"find_admin_role\" method really should be `Roles.find_admin` if it's allowed to exist at all -  there it's at least somewhat defensible even if it is only a single line method, because others are likely to find it there, and even if it seems relatively redundant, at least there it serves to document that this is indeed the canonical name for an admin role.</p>"},{"id":"b35806ff5efba64e","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by quickthrower2 in \"Ask HN: Who needs help this holidays?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:18:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:18:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1520.414003993491,"y":1748.9586572554863,"wires":[["590828ae64a7d1af"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497524\n<hr>\n<p>WTF.

We experimentally demonstrate an inverse design approach based on the superposition of guided mode sources, allowing the generation and complete control of free-space radiation directly from within a single 150 nm layer Ta2O5, showing low loss across visible and near-infrared spectra</i> [...]</p>"},{"id":"263e8e200e8c8d70","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by jurmous in \"The Netherlands starts realisation GPT-NL, its own open AI-language model\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:14:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:14:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2575.9998779296875,"y":2667.604736328125,"wires":[["f97211076c081d8f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497504\n<hr>\n<p>I am looking forward to this development since the open source models are not as good in Dutch compared to OpenAI.<p>Are there models good enough in Dutch which we could use in the mean time?</p>"},{"id":"cc2bb33ae9c94dfc","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by CapsAdmin in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:14:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:14:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1614.4690542455683,"y":3119.4691157665766,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497503\n<hr>\n<p>I'm not sure if it's the same, but if I listen to pure noise (to sleep or something) I can somewhat adjust my hearing to focus on certain frequency bands in the uniform noise making me to hear a ringing sound in the noise.

I downloaded a few apk program/files to get a certain Youtube version. The first apk was a certain apk for app patches called revanced manager. The seconded apk was YouTube blue apk v18.45.41from Youtubevanced.org. After Clicking the second download link on the web a downloading prompt showed up in the middle of my screen showing the YouTube blue v18.45.41apk was downloading after it had downloaded the prompt didn't go away but immediately gave the option to update the YouTube app so I clicked update which it did then after the prompt finished showing me it that it was done updating the prompt again didn't go away but gave me the option to open the YouTube app which I did. However after it didn't go to YouTube it redirected me to another site for a apk file called vanced micro g- to download. With out vanced micro g the apk programs/files I downloaded would be useless, So I downloaded it. (since the files require each other to create a program. If I didn't download the YouTube version to came to life) Promt shows up that's it's downloading and finishes and goes away. And instead of the youtube app that's already on my device being updated- the youtube thats already one my device which was here first wasn't updated and hasn't been updated but however a second youtube icon comes up that's a different version and is second YouTube app that now works the way I want. Except I'm not signed anymore. When I open the YouTube app the features work fine and the way I want but I'm not signed into my youtube accout. So I click sign in add account and am directed to a page that says<p>\"An app on your device is trying to sign into a google account. If this was intentional, use the sign in (or Huawei, if you have device with brand) button to connect to Google sign page, if not, press cancel to go back to the application that cuased this dialogue to show up.\"<p>Will my Google account get compromised. I have alot incorporated with my Google account like debit card info, linked webpages for account sign in, personal files, contacts, ECT. Has anyone had there private info/data stolen from signing into too your google account through vanced micro g for youtube version 18.45.41? Or have you not been breached since signing in?<p>I'm also thinking it's asking me that because I was signed into the YouTube account by connecting with Google option, when I signed up for youtube i didnt enter a email and new password, i just linked it with google.<p>Iv read alot about people using wordology as the word vanced myself and the and the three sylibles of \"micro g\" online but never once \"VANCED MICRO G\" four sylibles all together explaining anything. Iv read about people signing into vanced but I that could an abbreviation for revanced manger or something.

There is literature pointing to this as a common cause of TMJ issues.<p>I was told that the clicking sounds are just due to gas in the joint by a TMJ specialist, but I can literally feel my jaw jut to one side, so I'm convinced the bone is damaged.</p>"},{"id":"feba276a35f2fcdf","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by ReleaseCandidat in \"A medieval Gothic monastery built using CAD / CAM\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:25:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:25:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2590,"y":4316,"wires":[["7b8e9cc8fea20710"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497560\n<hr>\n<p>The real question is \"why\"?

Then I had a few days of road trip without the laptop and noticed improvement when I was driving, sitting up straight.<p>So I decided to work on this and bought a keyboard and a mouse and made myself a rule that I will always use the laptop with a stand or external display so I don't lean over the laptop and sit straight up the way it is ergonomically recommended, pretty much like it says on articles like this: <a href=\"https://healthandbalance.com.au/workstation-desk-posture-ergonomics/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://healthandbalance.com.au/workstation-desk-posture-erg...</a><p>I also begin doing neck exercises, recommended to me by an orthopedist(I got some neck pain for a few days, the orthopedist gave me a couple of movement I should do regularly to increase the straight of my neck muscles, I will leave links to the leaflets of the movements). I also did the push the chin to push your head back movement because although I didn't have clinically severe situation with my head moving forward I noticed that on my old photos my head wasn't leaning forward that much.<p>After a week or so after I started sitting right, my tinnitus begin to improve rapidly. I even began sleeping the orthopedically correct way and avoiding any stress positions. After some time I tried experimenting stress positions, like using the laptop the way I used to and the tinnitus returned in full force until I fix the posture and do some massages. After a year or two the tinnitus was almost completely gone and stress positions don't immediately bring it back anymore so I can use laptop again but if I'm not careful and overdo it, get carried away and lean into the screen it returns.<p>the leaflets:<p><a href=\"https://imgbb.com/XWnTZVB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://imgbb.com/XWnTZVB</a><p><a href=\"https://imgbb.com/r6PBbTK\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://imgbb.com/r6PBbTK</a></p>"},{"id":"b1e23d24b671102d","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by devjab in \"Three American climbers solve the 'last great problem in the Himalayas'\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3720.4767597158198,"y":4155.828154706901,"wires":[["a2131864d7e9de6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497602\n<hr>\n<p>Not necessarily proud, but the only thing that plays on my mind when I have to deal with feet (and inches since those are called “thumbs” in my country) is that guy in Braveheart going “some men are longer than others”.<p>It is what it is.</p>"},{"id":"d6e1979b4e3c3374","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by NoOn3 in \"Llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2831.9998779296875,"y":2555.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497601\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>"},{"id":"4b2cf4deec70ebe","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by vidarh in \"\"Useless Ruby sugar\": Endless (one-line) methods\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2771.9998779296875,"y":2027.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497600\n<hr>\n<p>As a Ruby developer, I can't stand this style either. People ought to be aware that to many of us this does indeed also screams \"beginner\". It shows people slavishly following advice they don't understand.<p>I kinda like the Clean Code advice of <i>small</i> functions/methods, but they should pack a punch, not just encapsulate barely more than their own name.<p>E.g. here's a single-line method from the Window class of my Ruby X11 window manager:<p><pre><code>    def type = (@type ||= get_property(:_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE, :atom)&.value.to_i)\n</code></pre>\nThis does one thing: It queries the X server for the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE atom attached to this window, and <i>if</i> a value is returned, it ensures the result is an integer (which will be 0 if what is returned is nil or somehow can't be parsed into an int, which would mean someone has been very naughty but defaulting to 0 is fine). It then ensures the value is memoised in `@type` (not doing more error checking here is fine, because failing is worse than defaulting to not knowing the window type, as we have no guarantee it's set in the first place)<p>Tiny functions <i>like that</i> are fine, because they encapsulate a sufficient amount of non-obvious logic in a very concise result. Being able to write `my_window.type` without caring about that logic is great. Trying to reduce your methods to compact little methods is great when it makes you write little functions that tells you a lot.<p>Unfortunately - and so I agree with your reaction to Clean Code - adhering to the rest of the Clean Code advice won't leave you with a bunch of little methods that pack a punch and remove a bunch of complexity, but a bunch of little methods that each encapsulate barely more than their method names worth of complexity.</p>"},{"id":"2f391ac702f5cef6","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by omnimus in \"RavynOS Finesse of macOS.

Once any disagreement comes up if you cant code, if you cant PR it… wont happen.<p>Also design is super hard to modularize and split into small pieces. With code random anybody can come and build/fix a feature. Not possible with design. Its mostly big picture work where you need to have deep context and follow it to get desired consistency.

When I'm on edge and anxious, the opposite appears to be true.</p>"},{"id":"7168900ac15fe9ad","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by pseg134 in \"Not Everything Is Google's Fault (Just Many Things)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:30:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:30:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1450,"y":1980,"wires":[["5ca951b2b64f9eb7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497581\n<hr>\n<p>Okay he didn’t say your would drop 10000x.

It is an incredibly misused technology, while it initially can be easy to integrate into your app. It increases the complexity of the app to a surprising degree. Now suddenly your little webapp have to handle how various devices handle redirects to external sites, receives callbacks. And all the weird ways oidc implementations uses cookies, handles return urls, logouts, profiles etc.<p>I am not so sure the model of using a central oidc solution as the primary login to your app is such a good idea. There are so many failure points in just getting to and fro the oidc portal that can break in all sorts of ways, with no good way of debugging, leaving users stranded in the middle of redirects. Especially as logs are split between 3 parties, the browser, the client (server) and the oidc relying party.<p>I ripped out our oidc primary login and implemented comparable features in my current company (this is probably not for everyone though), it has vastly reduced support tickets, and generally been a faster and more intuitive solution, but more expensive, and requires more domain knowledge. Still I'd rather have that than having a team spend years handling support tickets for endless social login issues.<p>If you choose to use oidc, please, please only use it for social logins, don't do oidc within oidc within oidc. Like a lot of these solutions such as Zitadel, Auth0, etc. It becomes a nightmare to support and mature.</p>"},{"id":"da1d6ce13ea5af93","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by zoky in \"MicroMac Technology's Home Page for Macintosh Upgrades and Accelerators (2000)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8209.193308432868,"y":20,"wires":[["e0f9c1cc59921d20"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497611\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"7f6fd893940bedc8","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by morsch in \"Researchers create humanitarian law digital emblem for the Red Cross\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2690,"y":4028,"wires":[["a431b2bdab7b9b92"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497610\n<hr>\n<p>It seems completely obvious that the jus in bello also covers cyber attacks.<p><i>Rule 15.
