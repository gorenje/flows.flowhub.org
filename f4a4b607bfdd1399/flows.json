I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.<p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?<p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Hearing loss is usually caused by damage and death of the hair cells——the sensory receptor cells that respond directly to sound. The hairs wiggle and open channels that flux ions across the hair cell membrane. This in turn causes these cell to releases neurotransmitters the induce action potentials (spikes) in the axons of spiral ganglion cell.<p>2. But hearing loss can also be caused by damage to the spiral ganglion cells themselves. These cells and their axons conduct spikes between cochlea and brain.<p>Basically, two mechanisms that contribute to hearing loss and tinnitus.<p>In the same way, blindness can also be caused by two major classes of cell loss—-1. the loss of photoreceptors (called retinal degeneration) or 2. by loss of axons in the optic nerve (retinal ganglion cell axons) and usually called glaucoma.<p>This lively study is focused on the consequences of hearing loss caused primarily by damage to the cochlear nerve fibers and their synapses in the cochlea, not the degeneration of hair cells per se. It is a great and  systematic study that support the idea that tinnitus can in some cases (many) be associated with nerve damage rather than hair cell loss.<p>If you want a good introduction to this work then read this review article by the same group.<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438769/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438769/</a></p>"},{"id":"ac438f8b038b3f18","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by phferreira in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

I'm only a neophyte Japanophile, but respect for masters of crafts seems a big part of their culture[0].  But experts can't make a living off vague cultural values. So the Japanese government, in their fervent desire to preserve their ethnic and national identity, pours a lot of money and attention on craftsmen associated with their cultural heritage[1]. And now the cultural values are important, because Japanese voters have a more positive view of this spending than citizens of other countries might.<p>[0]Yes, all cultures respect experts. But what matters is how much respect relative to other figures. For example, in the United States, business leaders enjoy more respect than master craftsmen.<p>[1]<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110813130933/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03_ver03.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://web.archive.org/web/20110813130933/http://www.bunka....</a></p>"},{"id":"86093f857162bf04","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by hexsprite in \"Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?

The side with the worst hearing is also the one with worse tinnitus.\nMy loss probably comes from many many ear infections as a child (plus hearing to loud music on a basement, and just bad genetics).<p>Things that make my tinnitus worse:\n * Basically, any kind of \"hearing effort\" stresses me out and makes my tinnitus worse (busy places, bars, parties, etc. are the worse, but even music on my headsets, which I enjoy, make it worse). Maybe this puts some doubts on the \"phantom limb\" theory?\n * Stress\n * Not sleeping well\n * After doing exercise. I play sports, run and lift light weights. After any of these exercises, it gets a bit worse\n * Driving a car: the humming noise of car drive is probably the worse for me\n * If I clinch my jaws (mimicking a strong bite) I hear another, surprisingly similar tone... However, I feel like it's a different thing, not related.<p>I wished I had a similar list of things that lessen it... I don't :-)\nHowever: I started using prescription hearing aids. And although they don't really help with tinnitus directly, I do feel much better: general noise doesn't bother me as much, and of course I hear better :-).<p>Recommendation: if you have some hearing loss, don't wait to use a hearing aid, just like you don't wait to wear glasses. They are expensive, but worth it. And no, they are not just simple \"earbuds\".<p>Confession: I play the drums, although very occasionally. I have no proof but I'm sure I had hearing loss way before I started playing.

This noise typically results from the movement of small muscles around your ear, particularly the tensor tympani muscle in your middle ear. These muscles contract to dampen certain sounds, like chewing, but can also be voluntarily or involuntarily activated when you move your ears. This action can cause a vibration or movement of the eardrum, leading to the crackling sound.

If GUI development were still as easy as the drag and drop builders in Delphi 7 and VB6 with a bunch of static 800x600 monitors and double-click to edit component code-behind, we’d be shoehorning fewer apps into HTML and making more desktop apps.<p>I remember how big of a pain in the ass Windows distribution (alone) was in the 2000s with entire businesses like InstallShield built around it. Tack compatibility testing on top of that and a desktop app for a single OS because a massive effort. With the web you could just upload PHP and off to the race. That slowly evolved into what we had today via jquery and electron and friends but what won was distribution and ease of development, despite all the handwringing people do about frontend. The grass isn’t greener on the other side and hasn’t been for decades.<p>It’s not even remotely competitive anymore. My favorite example is GoldenLayout: it takes me less than a few hours to read the docs and implement a full blown tabbed and split screen interface using a third party library and combine it with any framework I want like React, Svelte, or just vanilla JS. Each desktop framework have their own solutions to the problem usually in the form of commercial components but even in the best case, they take lots more time to wire together.</p>"},{"id":"31f6a640c12c86b6","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by rozenmd in \"Ask HN: Those making $500/month on side projects in 2023 – Show and tell\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:28:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:28:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1764.0001220703125,"y":3291.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498816\n<hr>\n<p>This is exactly what I mean by \"market until you think it's too much, and then some\" - if it was truly too much, the average forum member would know (imo).</p>"},{"id":"efbb4a13af38f88","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by creesch in \"Chrome's next weapon in the War on Ad Blockers: Slower extension updates\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:28:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:28:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2230,"y":784,"wires":[["f9b1f67c51b74599"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498815\n<hr>\n<p>Brave is an ad company with weird crypto stuff sprinkled in.

But if you make a single static regex part of your configuration your users are stuck with it.</p>"},{"id":"f931ea9ff2a71bdb","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by wavemode in \"GCP Incidents\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:32:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:32:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8414.794544352419,"y":963.7620610907428,"wires":[["5ca951b2b64f9eb7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498844\n<hr>\n<p>Oh, for goddamn sure.

The danger of using the stones was twofold: 1) not all the stones were accounted for, you couldn’t know who was listening in and 2) Sauron had one of the stones.<p>A dark lord who wanted to rule the world in fire and ash and darkness had this surveillance tool and used it to corrupt the other known users of the seeing stones, Denethor and Sauroman. That was the plot structure of these stones. Aragon and Merry/Pippin were able to use them against Sauron, who thought the hobbits with Aragorn might be Frodo. But again, to me this shows the danger of making decisions based on spying technology. Sauron committed his forces against Gondor because his intel told him and it led to his eye being distracted from Frodo/Sam/Gollum sneaking over the mountains and into Mt. Doom.<p>Why you would name your surveillance company after that is beyond me. To me it would be like getting aboard a plane run by Icarus airlines or naming the next big boat/plane/rocketship Titanic.</p>"},{"id":"3bc564cfc9b16f0c","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by scruple in \"To protect kids, the EPA wants total removal of lead pipes\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:37:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:37:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1500,"y":3492,"wires":[["e538874c851ad6e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498882\n<hr>\n<p>I have a tankless, too, and after reading the article and these comments had the same thoughts...</p>"},{"id":"e095b32cbf3c39bf","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by nkurz in \"Should we believe Americans when they say the economy is bad?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:37:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 14:37:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-356.0001220703125,"y":1627.604736328125,"wires":[["c6950c6b4ee48876"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498880\n<hr>\n<p>Good questions.

Always preach democracy, but seize power as fast and as ruthlessly as possible.<p>5. By encouraging government extravagances, destroy its credit, produce years of inflation with rising prices and general discontent.<p>6. Incite unnecessary strikes in vital industries, encourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of the government towards such disorders.\"<p>- Tomas Schumann (post-KGB-defection Yuri Bezmenov), \"Love Letter to America\" [1]<p>An effective way to prepare a child (newcomer to language) for the timeless bombardment of foreign ideological subterfuge is by telling a simple story of how paradise was lost [2] because the soothsayer targets the spirit of the life-affirming (compassionate) component of the city-state as the most direct path to that which provides its strength. The taste of judgement is forbidden because you will then spend your days (as an agitated, less productive civilian being physically protected by an authority) wondering about how local conditions should be changed according to your personal opinions&comfort which means you have rejected the requirement of loyalty&obedience. At this point you are not worth being provided for since you become the source of expensive internal convulsions, and are therefore cast back out into the unorganized chaos for which need of the nation-state arose. In the same breath, through this story-telling, you elevate the ideals of the assignment of order&purpose, creation, cooperation, and organization as central tenets for the foundation of civilization.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/subversion-death-from-within-9547\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/subversion-death-fr...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://ia800602.us.archive.org/11/items/love-letter-america/love-letter-america.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ia800602.us.archive.org/11/items/love-letter-america...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2LhrsbtRhlo?t=1674\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/2LhrsbtRhlo?t=1674</a></p>"},{"id":"e3e5ab5de7f62928","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by K0balt in \"Tiny Volumetric Display\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:09:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:09:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2758.0001220703125,"y":1171.604736328125,"wires":[["19f5a0207b9f2442"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499092\n<hr>\n<p>It seems like this might\nWork even better with a two sided OLED screen (2 screens back to back) rather than led array, for better resolution?

This is being written about because until now, despite a community of hyper competitive individuals vying for first ascents in extreme environments, <i>no one</i> has done this route until now; it was unimaginable, basically, as something you could possibly survive. But these mad lads had the imagination to see it was possible, and the skill sets to achieve it.<p>As for 'dice rolls', it depends. In climbing there is \"objective danger\" - danger you cannot really control, like your route passes under a serac that collapses frequently, and \"subjective danger\" that you can control - you step on a loose hold and fall. They spend months planning, trying to reduce the objective dangers as much as possible, and of course years of training to reduce the subjective dangers. Summarizing all of that as a 'dice roll', while it might capture the percentages of particular high risk climbs, seems to miss the mark a bit. Spend a night in a climbing hut, or hanging in a tent/portaledge off a mountain side and it's endless talk about this sort of thing.

I don't know, I've seen people make this pitch better.\"<p>To clarify, I was pointing out that you're more invested in your beliefs than I am in mine. If I see that I'm wrong, I can simply sell my bitcoin at a profit and walk away - my bitcoin ownership is not a psychological barrier to a change of my belief (a hypothesis you made). But in order for you to change your opinion at this stage, you will also have to come to terms with that fact that through your own mistakes you failed to buy bitcoin at prices probably 10x-100x cheaper than they currently are. This is the barrier to change of belief that you incorrectly accused me of.<p>> \"It does seem like your definition of \"understands Bitcoin\" is \"agrees with you\", so that's not particularly compelling as an argument.\"<p>It's true. The fact is that bitcoin presents itself on the surface as a combination of \"Ponzi scheme\" alarms bells, combined with massive, wasteful energy use. Most people see this and believe that they've seen through the hype that the dumb people have fallen for and walk away, albeit a bit disgruntled about the waste of energy that is affecting everyone.<p>They'll probably think things like, \"I couldn't really care less about this crypto rubbish, but at least do it in an energy efficient way like [insert random shitcoin here].<p>Almost every bitcoiner has been there, even Michael Saylor!. It actually takes a deep insight into a number of widely differing areas of knowledge/expertise to see the whole picture (which also involves see though some of the nonsense of traditional finance/Keynesian economics) and only then does it make sense, and only when it makes sense does it become an excellent use of energy, rather than a waste of energy. If you miss one piece of the jigsaw, it's an enormous waste of energy. So far every point you have made against bitcoin is one that I also made at one point along my learning curve but after 1000's of hours of deeper learning and contemplation, have realised they were wrong.<p>So, let's just start with the first of my misconceptions and at least agree on the facts, rather than any conjecture, before continuing on :\"Miners don't validate the transactions ($100 nodes people can run at home do that)\"<p>> \"Bitcoin proves chain validity using a system called proof of work\"\nOkay, so proof of work doesn't prove anything other than work. The chain validity is proven by the global network of low-cost nodes that check the chain (including the claimed proof of work) against the rules of bitcoin, defined by the individual node itself. \nIf a miner \"mines\" a block of transactions in a way that doesn't conform to bitcoin as defined by my node, those transactions didn't happen (according to me). If someone makes a change that I believe is detrimental enough to bitcoin that I'm willing to take a stand, then I won't apply the change to my node. Assuming I'm correct in my opinion, other bitcoiners will likely do the same and ultimately the network will split into two separate networks of nodes/miners, the best of which will ultimately win. This was seen in the \"block-size wars\" (were you on the side of the big-blockers?), which showed that the miners can mine according to which ever rules they like, but their work will be ignored by people who think those rules make bitcoin weaker/worse and the work will ultimately be wasted if those people were correct.<p>> \"To be fair, it is true that individual nodes can validate whether or not a proposed chain is completely incorrect, but so heckin what\"<p>So you agree to certain point, but not that the nodes have any power in defining what bitcoin is.  Does my explanation above, including the outcome of the \"block-size wars\" change that belief in any way?<p>> \"The important part is that the network specifically trusts whatever the longest blockchain is, and that entire security system is based on the entire network constantly racing itself to increase the chain's length.\"<p>I agree, but will qualify that the nodes on the network only trust the longest blockchain that confirms to the rules that the nodes' chosen code defines. If my node says the new longest chain is not bitcoin, then it's not bitcoin and I ignore it.<p>> \"The inefficiency is the point, the point is that the network can spend more energy than you individually can. It outspends your access to compute power. \"The network outspends your attack\" is basically the definition of a proof of work blockchain. So at a purely technical level, your explanation here already has issues. But let's ignore that and talk about economics:\"<p>So I agree on the fundamental point of \"the network outspends your attack\". But I don't agree that this makes it inefficient and I don't see how it highlights issues in my explanation (could you elaborate?)\nTo me the question of a system's efficiency is \"does this system solve the problem while using the lowest amount of energy possible?\". And so we first need to agree on what problem bitcoin is solving, before we can determine whether it's efficient or not. If you agree with what I've written in my other points above, then we can move on to that, but let's just get the facts about the blockchain straightened out and agreed on first.</p>"},{"id":"f98346d00a52597a","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by onlyrealcuzzo in \"New York will plant trees using new tech to maximize foliage impact\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:16:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:16:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2080,"y":2396,"wires":[["e751abf8c5e0d4ad"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499133\n<hr>\n<p>Rents only go up if more people want to live somewhere - or, maybe short-term, if the government levies more taxes.<p>If you make everywhere nice, then you don't need to pay a premium to live somewhere nice.<p>Maybe you have to pay a miniscule amount more in property taxes.<p>You could just stop running trash & sewer service and let the city turn to garbage if you want lower rents.

(Though there are also the new 3D monitors that don't require glasses, but not a lot of people have gotten to see those in person yet.)<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_display#Swept-volume_display\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_display#Swept-volum...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.ledpulse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ledpulse.com/</a></p>"},{"id":"309047b2649cab52","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by InCityDreams in \"Britain's scariest libel firm\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:28:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:28:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-3300.0001220703125,"y":1611.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499223\n<hr>\n<p>...allegedly.</p>"},{"id":"505c4eff4341cf2c","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by MPSimmons in \"Why Did These LEDs Light Up?

A friend told me I'd gotten mentioned here so I thought I'd drop in and offer some explanation, hope that's okay!<p>It's still in very early development, I mostly put it up on github so I could show it to some friends and get some review on it - the 'revision 0' hardware in there was only ever intended as a minimum-viable prototype to prove the concept and let me get started on driver development.<p>As far as licensing goes, once it's more polished I'm planning on releasing it under some kind of open hardware license. I've no interest in making money off of it beyond hopefully selling a small run of them to recoup the cost of development. Right now, though, I'd strongly recommend against trying to build it or derive anything from it in its current state - the Revision 0 hardware was only ever intended as a minimum-viable product, it has a number of hardware bugs, and I may make some software-incompatible changes in the next revision.<p>Having said that, things are progressing well. Aforementioned hardware bugs aside, the initial bringup of the board was a success, it sends and receives packets as it should, but there's plenty on the to-do list for the next revision.<p>It's driver development that's the killer. The Classic Mac OS network stack is ... interesting ... I've got the basics all there, but it's very prone to dramatic and difficult-to-debug crashes at the moment.<p>The driver that's up on github is quite out of date, but my work-in-progress is an absolute mess of debugging code and commented-out bits, so it'll probably be a while before I get that cleaned up and published.<p>If anyone wants to know more, there's a sporadically-updated Twitter thread about it at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/halkyardo/status/1723914693595607525\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/halkyardo/status/1723914693595607525</a>, and a more in-depth thread on 68kmla at <a href=\"https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/sethernet-and-sethernet-30-a-new-take-on-pds-ethernet.45888/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/sethernet-and-sether...</a></p>"},{"id":"508a0e863f4e5173","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by brightball in \"Ask HN: What are some unpopular technologies you wish people knew more about?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:34:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:34:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6843,"y":1171.1914046002203,"wires":[["ba0cf485e4eba87a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499263\n<hr>\n<p>Just so you know, the call for speakers for the 2024 Carolina Code Conference (polyglot) will open January 1.<p>A Nim talk would be a great fit for the event.</p>"},{"id":"acf02b6501216dbf","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by JCharante in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

Frameworks in general make what you want to do easier to do, at least from a developer experience perspective. Generally this meets the mark for most use-cases, but has proven to be a problem (especially in ORMs) if you want to go outside of the box.\nThey seek to abstract complex or cumbersome logic into more consumable APIs, and in most cases this ends up being a footgun.<p>Point I am trying to make is: learn all the nitty gritty about CSS (specificity, box layout, selectors, etc...) and really understand how the base language works. Then go play with frameworks, figure out which ones fixes the parts you don't like, and makes the parts you do like better.</p>"},{"id":"daffa91d588545c7","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by xwowsersx in \"Ask HN: What are some unpopular technologies you wish people knew more about?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:34:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:34:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6843,"y":1203.1914046002203,"wires":[["ba0cf485e4eba87a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499256\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks!
