year.<p>Last year we had an incredible response to a thread offering assistance to those in the HN community. You can read it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34122118<p>Last year we were able to provide nearly $20k worth of support to community members. I know things have only gotten more challenging since then for a number of us, so I wanted to make sure I provided more time this year for people to reach out.<p>As usual, this is not a request for donations. Last year and this year I am content to finance this operation myself (although a number of people did step up and offer additional support). All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.<p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds. Reasonable requests include:<p>- Holiday housing<p>- Toys/gifts for family members<p>- Food<p>- Travel assistance<p>- Medical expenses<p>- Entertainment for the family<p>I understand, as a formerly homeless person myself, that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us.<p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.<p>Happy holidays!<p>- Alexander</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Account to make service changes (plus getting a hold of support is difficult, which is good in this context). However, I'm trying to move away from Google services and want to use Fastmail on iOS instead of Gmail on Android, but Google Fi requires the use of a Google account (e.g. for the Fi app, which provides critical functionality IIUC).<p>So to make a long-story short, I'm looking for another wireless carrier, but I'm concerned about SIM-swapping attacks (I know, I shouldn't be using SMS-based 2FA, but many services fallback to it and don't allow this to be disabled).<p>So, which carriers offer some kind of protection against SIM swapping, ideally something more than a 4-digit PIN that's texted to you (looking at you Mint)? During my research, I found https://www.efani.com/, but this seems like overkill for a non-high profile person.<p>I'm based in the US.<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496304\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496304</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"99843d87d67d61f","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Show HN: Browser based Image Editor with AI","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:57:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:57:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4603.9998779296875,"y":1067.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/smyja/Mirage\">https://github.com/smyja/Mirage</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497166\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497166</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"c86605cbf5a8f543","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Advent of Code: scaling adventures (2020)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4851.9998779296875,"y":1019.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"dbb98b3d3bd56bfe","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"OpenAI's GPT store delayed to next year","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:09:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3111.9998779296875,"y":1019.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984497/openai-gpt-store-delayed-ai-gpt\">https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984497/openai-gpt-store-delayed-ai-gpt</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497239\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497239</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"88713a9149995bd6","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"This week in KDE: changing the wallpaper from within System Settings","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4635.9998779296875,"y":1403.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://pointieststick.com/2023/12/01/this-week-in-kde-changing-the-wallpaper-from-within-system-settings/\">https://pointieststick.com/2023/12/01/this-week-in-kde-changing-the-wallpaper-from-within-system-settings/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497228\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497228</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5e58fd1cb469d372","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"The fastest biotech to go to in-human trials","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:08:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3111.9998779296875,"y":1067.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://mxschons.com/2023/alvea-case-study-of-the-fastest-biotech-to-go-to-in-human-trials-5-6-drug-development-series/\">https://mxschons.com/2023/alvea-case-study-of-the-fastest-biotech-to-go-to-in-human-trials-5-6-drug-development-series/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497227\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497227</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8e20318da781070b","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"JavaScript WTF: Why does every() return true for empty arrays?

Yet. Maybe it will in the future, then DRY it up <i>then</i>.  Secondly, DRY is meaningless if applied at units so small that you replace one invocation of a method with another invocation of a method when the arguments to the first one are obvious. E.g. consider this from the example:<p><pre><code>    def find_admin_role\n        Roles.find_by(name: 'admin')\n    end\n</code></pre>\nAssuming your application consistently uses `name`, and is consistent about class names, `find_admin_role` is not saving you complexity over Roles.find_by(name: 'admin'). People familiar with Ruby ORMs and tasked with finding an admin role will go looking for finders in the Role class. They're not likely to find your method, and so are likely to write their own.<p>The former introduces complexity that is <i>only warranted</i> to me if 1) the method of finding the admin role grows more complex so it's non-obvious, 2) the method you DRY it up into is actually being used at least twice, 3) it's placed in the most appropriate class.<p>And it's that second where YAGNI comes in. By all means, DRY up logic. But don't do it before it <i>actually</i> stops you repeating yourself in a way that is actually significant.<p>To #3, that \"find_admin_role\" method really should be `Roles.find_admin` if it's allowed to exist at all -  there it's at least somewhat defensible even if it is only a single line method, because others are likely to find it there, and even if it seems relatively redundant, at least there it serves to document that this is indeed the canonical name for an admin role.</p>"},{"id":"b35806ff5efba64e","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by quickthrower2 in \"Ask HN: Who needs help this holidays?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:18:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:18:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2340,"y":5628,"wires":[["590828ae64a7d1af"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497524\n<hr>\n<p>WTF.

I downloaded a few apk program/files to get a certain Youtube version. The first apk was a certain apk for app patches called revanced manager. The seconded apk was YouTube blue apk v18.45.41from Youtubevanced.org. After Clicking the second download link on the web a downloading prompt showed up in the middle of my screen showing the YouTube blue v18.45.41apk was downloading after it had downloaded the prompt didn't go away but immediately gave the option to update the YouTube app so I clicked update which it did then after the prompt finished showing me it that it was done updating the prompt again didn't go away but gave me the option to open the YouTube app which I did. However after it didn't go to YouTube it redirected me to another site for a apk file called vanced micro g- to download. With out vanced micro g the apk programs/files I downloaded would be useless, So I downloaded it. (since the files require each other to create a program. If I didn't download the YouTube version to came to life) Promt shows up that's it's downloading and finishes and goes away. And instead of the youtube app that's already on my device being updated- the youtube thats already one my device which was here first wasn't updated and hasn't been updated but however a second youtube icon comes up that's a different version and is second YouTube app that now works the way I want. Except I'm not signed anymore. When I open the YouTube app the features work fine and the way I want but I'm not signed into my youtube accout. So I click sign in add account and am directed to a page that says<p>\"An app on your device is trying to sign into a google account. If this was intentional, use the sign in (or Huawei, if you have device with brand) button to connect to Google sign page, if not, press cancel to go back to the application that cuased this dialogue to show up.\"<p>Will my Google account get compromised. I have alot incorporated with my Google account like debit card info, linked webpages for account sign in, personal files, contacts, ECT. Has anyone had there private info/data stolen from signing into too your google account through vanced micro g for youtube version 18.45.41? Or have you not been breached since signing in?<p>I'm also thinking it's asking me that because I was signed into the YouTube account by connecting with Google option, when I signed up for youtube i didnt enter a email and new password, i just linked it with google.<p>Iv read alot about people using wordology as the word vanced myself and the and the three sylibles of \"micro g\" online but never once \"VANCED MICRO G\" four sylibles all together explaining anything. Iv read about people signing into vanced but I that could an abbreviation for revanced manger or something.

There is literature pointing to this as a common cause of TMJ issues.<p>I was told that the clicking sounds are just due to gas in the joint by a TMJ specialist, but I can literally feel my jaw jut to one side, so I'm convinced the bone is damaged.</p>"},{"id":"feba276a35f2fcdf","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by ReleaseCandidat in \"A medieval Gothic monastery built using CAD / CAM\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:25:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:25:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2590,"y":4204,"wires":[["7b8e9cc8fea20710"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497560\n<hr>\n<p>The real question is \"why\"?

Then I had a few days of road trip without the laptop and noticed improvement when I was driving, sitting up straight.<p>So I decided to work on this and bought a keyboard and a mouse and made myself a rule that I will always use the laptop with a stand or external display so I don't lean over the laptop and sit straight up the way it is ergonomically recommended, pretty much like it says on articles like this: <a href=\"https://healthandbalance.com.au/workstation-desk-posture-ergonomics/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://healthandbalance.com.au/workstation-desk-posture-erg...</a><p>I also begin doing neck exercises, recommended to me by an orthopedist(I got some neck pain for a few days, the orthopedist gave me a couple of movement I should do regularly to increase the straight of my neck muscles, I will leave links to the leaflets of the movements). I also did the push the chin to push your head back movement because although I didn't have clinically severe situation with my head moving forward I noticed that on my old photos my head wasn't leaning forward that much.<p>After a week or so after I started sitting right, my tinnitus begin to improve rapidly. I even began sleeping the orthopedically correct way and avoiding any stress positions. After some time I tried experimenting stress positions, like using the laptop the way I used to and the tinnitus returned in full force until I fix the posture and do some massages. After a year or two the tinnitus was almost completely gone and stress positions don't immediately bring it back anymore so I can use laptop again but if I'm not careful and overdo it, get carried away and lean into the screen it returns.<p>the leaflets:<p><a href=\"https://imgbb.com/XWnTZVB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://imgbb.com/XWnTZVB</a><p><a href=\"https://imgbb.com/r6PBbTK\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://imgbb.com/r6PBbTK</a></p>"},{"id":"b1e23d24b671102d","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by devjab in \"Three American climbers solve the 'last great problem in the Himalayas'\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3710.4767597158198,"y":4107.828154706901,"wires":[["a2131864d7e9de6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497602\n<hr>\n<p>Not necessarily proud, but the only thing that plays on my mind when I have to deal with feet (and inches since those are called “thumbs” in my country) is that guy in Braveheart going “some men are longer than others”.<p>It is what it is.</p>"},{"id":"d6e1979b4e3c3374","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by NoOn3 in \"Llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3111.9998779296875,"y":2363.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497601\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>"},{"id":"4b2cf4deec70ebe","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by vidarh in \"\"Useless Ruby sugar\": Endless (one-line) methods\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:36:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3111.9998779296875,"y":1931.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497600\n<hr>\n<p>As a Ruby developer, I can't stand this style either. People ought to be aware that to many of us this does indeed also screams \"beginner\". It shows people slavishly following advice they don't understand.<p>I kinda like the Clean Code advice of <i>small</i> functions/methods, but they should pack a punch, not just encapsulate barely more than their own name.<p>E.g. here's a single-line method from the Window class of my Ruby X11 window manager:<p><pre><code>    def type = (@type ||= get_property(:_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE, :atom)&.value.to_i)\n</code></pre>\nThis does one thing: It queries the X server for the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE atom attached to this window, and <i>if</i> a value is returned, it ensures the result is an integer (which will be 0 if what is returned is nil or somehow can't be parsed into an int, which would mean someone has been very naughty but defaulting to 0 is fine). It then ensures the value is memoised in `@type` (not doing more error checking here is fine, because failing is worse than defaulting to not knowing the window type, as we have no guarantee it's set in the first place)<p>Tiny functions <i>like that</i> are fine, because they encapsulate a sufficient amount of non-obvious logic in a very concise result. Being able to write `my_window.type` without caring about that logic is great. Trying to reduce your methods to compact little methods is great when it makes you write little functions that tells you a lot.<p>Unfortunately - and so I agree with your reaction to Clean Code - adhering to the rest of the Clean Code advice won't leave you with a bunch of little methods that pack a punch and remove a bunch of complexity, but a bunch of little methods that each encapsulate barely more than their method names worth of complexity.</p>"},{"id":"2f391ac702f5cef6","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by omnimus in \"RavynOS Finesse of macOS.

Once any disagreement comes up if you cant code, if you cant PR it… wont happen.<p>Also design is super hard to modularize and split into small pieces. With code random anybody can come and build/fix a feature. Not possible with design. Its mostly big picture work where you need to have deep context and follow it to get desired consistency. For projects like OS gui that requires huge commitment (most likely full time).<p>But i think copying existing well made software can make this a lot easier.

It is an incredibly misused technology, while it initially can be easy to integrate into your app. It increases the complexity of the app to a surprising degree. Now suddenly your little webapp have to handle how various devices handle redirects to external sites, receives callbacks. And all the weird ways oidc implementations uses cookies, handles return urls, logouts, profiles etc.<p>I am not so sure the model of using a central oidc solution as the primary login to your app is such a good idea. There are so many failure points in just getting to and fro the oidc portal that can break in all sorts of ways, with no good way of debugging, leaving users stranded in the middle of redirects. Especially as logs are split between 3 parties, the browser, the client (server) and the oidc relying party.<p>I ripped out our oidc primary login and implemented comparable features in my current company (this is probably not for everyone though), it has vastly reduced support tickets, and generally been a faster and more intuitive solution, but more expensive, and requires more domain knowledge. Still I'd rather have that than having a team spend years handling support tickets for endless social login issues.<p>If you choose to use oidc, please, please only use it for social logins, don't do oidc within oidc within oidc. Like a lot of these solutions such as Zitadel, Auth0, etc. It becomes a nightmare to support and mature.</p>"},{"id":"da1d6ce13ea5af93","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by zoky in \"MicroMac Technology's Home Page for Macintosh Upgrades and Accelerators (2000)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2174.9999490578684,"y":4955,"wires":[["e0f9c1cc59921d20"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497611\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"7f6fd893940bedc8","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by morsch in \"Researchers create humanitarian law digital emblem for the Red Cross\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:39:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2680,"y":3836,"wires":[["a431b2bdab7b9b92"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497610\n<hr>\n<p>It seems completely obvious that the jus in bello also covers cyber attacks.<p><i>Rule 15.

There are several, including hearing loss, which (as someone here points out) possibly produces tinnitus in a manner similar to how limb loss can cause phantom limb pain. The nervous system isn't like plumbing, it's a tangled web of self-adjusting feedback loops. Once an input is severed, an area of the tangled web may lose an important calibrating input. Neurons don't emit \"noise signals\" (or \"pain signals\" or whatever)  they just depolarise in response to stimulation, and altered calibration alters which neurons depolarise and how often. The frequency and number of certain neurons depolarising is experienced as noise (or pain or whatever) by the conscious human they belong to.<p>Good talk here[0] BUT BE WARNED, I recall* that there's a high-pitched squeal during this talk as a demonstration of what tinnitus is like for done people. It's extremely nasty especially if you're wearing headphones.<p>Incidentally, the self-adjusting feedback loop model helps explain why things like wiggling your jaw can alter the experience of tinnitus. Due to wiring issues, sensory input from muscles and joints can get mixed in with the auditory inputs. A similar mechanism (which isn't fully understood) helps explain why, for example, people having a heart attack can experience pain in the left arm. There's nothing wrong with the arm, the normal sensory signals from the arm are mixing with those from the heart.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=XGq3MXQlRJs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=XGq3MXQlRJs</a><p>* Can't verify right now, trusting my memory.</p>"},{"id":"d61ae0ae386cb968","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by phendrenad2 in \"Chrome's next weapon in the War on Ad Blockers: Slower extension updates\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1382.0577392578125,"y":3577.928140640259,"wires":[["f9b1f67c51b74599"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497678\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"fa41cd2df9ec4dfe","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by jonathanlydall in \"Google Maps now looks more like Apple Maps – and a lot of people aren't happy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2010,"y":7040,"wires":[["9d3df73e6a74d3f6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497677\n<hr>\n<p>More and more I'm seeing headlines suffixed similar to the above \"...and a lot of people aren't happy\" or \"...and people are upset\" and it just seems to me like shoddy work by article authors.<p>These kinds of headlines make me assume the article is not going to bother to give a balanced or researched analysis, but instead just talk about how people are feeling about things, without necessarily quantifying anything.<p>It's okay to have feelings or opinions, but that's generally pretty useless to other people without some rationalization or justification as to why you have them.<p>I would have been far more inclined to read an article with a headline like \"Google updates its Maps to look more like Apple's at the expense of ease of use\".</p>"},{"id":"197fa01f45738b89","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by nvm0n2 in \"Star neuroscientist may have manipulated data to support a major stroke trial\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3879.9998779296875,"y":2795.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497676\n<hr>\n<p>Very substantial, to the extent that the dataset was made up.

Often it implements session using cookies, which given the state you were in previously. Maybe you wanted to embed the login page on your own site (iframe or webview), now the cookies are flagged as third party cookies and blocked in a variety of context.<p>Especially in an app context it becomes a minefield of half baked webview implementations, browser specific quirks, and limitations on how to call back to the host app which initiated the flow.<p>Other questions are how do we handle return urls, i.e. return to where we started the login flow from? there isn't a good answer in oidc, unless you use some of the more extreme flows. It becomes tricky to implement without opening yourself to open redirect attacks, which kind of voids the benefits of oidc (that you don't have to handle the complexity of the authentication).<p>Also there are endless variations of the oidc flow, the most common being code flow, which is pretty much what you describe. But it gets increasingly complex as you have to handle native app login (PKCE pronounced pixie). Using these flows you end up becoming as much an expert in the technology as you would've been just implementing authentication and identity yourself.</p>"},{"id":"d873c76edabc6f49","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by JCharante in \"Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?

So in this model academic scientists develop a foundation of firm and rigorous theory about how nature works, publish a literature on it for the good of all mankind, and then shorter term applied research is done by companies to derive practical insights from that literature.<p>That model doesn't seem right, because there are lots of corporate research programmes into fundamental theory that were/are lavishly funded despite a decade+ of no ROI, most obviously at the moment AI. But let's put that aside and pretend it's true.<p>Problem is that humanities and social studies don't produce a body of theory on which anything can be built. Humanities produces only critical theory, which despite the name is more like a belief system than a scientific theory. The social studies produce a lot of that too, but even outside critical theory their output is just a giant pile of random thought bubbles and mini-studies to try and prove them. There's nothing much linking these studies, no frameworks that make reliable new predictions. Instead we get an endless stream of Just So claims that fall apart when people try to replicate them, but even failure to replicate doesn't have any impact because there's nothing underneath them to be invalidated. At most it's shown that this one specific paper isn't reliable.<p>Contrast to something like physics where the work of academic theorists is all about coming up with unified theories of everything, which could then be used to develop practical applications. Einstein is super famous because he invalidated large swathes of theory and opened up space for new theory to be developed. Social studies don't have any equivalent to Einstein and can't by design.</p>"},{"id":"b92f0fe5f0701519","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by gumballindie in \"Google Maps now looks more like Apple Maps – and a lot of people aren't happy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:15:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:15:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2010,"y":7232,"wires":[["9d3df73e6a74d3f6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497773\n<hr>\n<p>Google needs to have a serious review of their product management hiring practices.

built-in ad blocking, though some dislike its use of cryptocurrency.\nFirefox is only decent tier due to its many annoying default features, but can be excellent with the right privacy-focused user.js file.\nIcecat is decent tier for free software purists due to its use of LibreJS blocking non-free scripts, though this breaks many sites.\nLibrewolf is excellent tier as an easy to use private version of Firefox without much configuration needed.\nChromium-based browsers like Vivaldi can be good but have limitations from not being fully open source.\nClosed source browsers like Chrome, Edge and Opera are automatically placed in spyware tier due to privacy concerns.\nQutebrowser is decent tier for power users due to its keyboard-focused design but has issues with advanced ad blocking.\nWaterfox is excellent tier as a lightweight Firefox fork, though its ownership by an ad company concerns some.\nOverall, Brave, Librewolf and hardened Firefox are recommended as having the best balance of privacy, usability and customizability.</p>"},{"id":"3f37aae50d305ae0","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by perrygeo in \"The Revenge of the
