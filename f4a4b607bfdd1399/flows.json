I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.<p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?<p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

The taste of judgement is forbidden because you will then spend your days (as an agitated, less productive civilian being physically protected by an authority) wondering about how local conditions should be changed according to your personal opinions&comfort which means you have rejected the requirement of loyalty&obedience. At this point you are not worth being provided for since you become the source of expensive internal convulsions, and are therefore cast back out into the unorganized chaos for which need of the nation-state arose. In the same breath, through this story-telling, you elevate the ideals of the assignment of order&purpose, creation, cooperation, and organization as central tenets for the foundation of civilization.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/subversion-death-from-within-9547\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/subversion-death-fr...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://ia800602.us.archive.org/11/items/love-letter-america/love-letter-america.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ia800602.us.archive.org/11/items/love-letter-america...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2LhrsbtRhlo?t=1674\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/2LhrsbtRhlo?t=1674</a></p>"},{"id":"e3e5ab5de7f62928","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by K0balt in \"Tiny Volumetric Display\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:09:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:09:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2758.0001220703125,"y":995.604736328125,"wires":[["19f5a0207b9f2442"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499092\n<hr>\n<p>It seems like this might\nWork even better with a two sided OLED screen (2 screens back to back) rather than led array, for better resolution?

But these mad lads had the imagination to see it was possible, and the skill sets to achieve it.<p>As for 'dice rolls', it depends. In climbing there is \"objective danger\" - danger you cannot really control, like your route passes under a serac that collapses frequently, and \"subjective danger\" that you can control - you step on a loose hold and fall. They spend months planning, trying to reduce the objective dangers as much as possible, and of course years of training to reduce the subjective dangers. Summarizing all of that as a 'dice roll', while it might capture the percentages of particular high risk climbs, seems to miss the mark a bit. Spend a night in a climbing hut, or hanging in a tent/portaledge off a mountain side and it's endless talk about this sort of thing.

I don't know, I've seen people make this pitch better.\"<p>To clarify, I was pointing out that you're more invested in your beliefs than I am in mine. If I see that I'm wrong, I can simply sell my bitcoin at a profit and walk away - my bitcoin ownership is not a psychological barrier to a change of my belief (a hypothesis you made). But in order for you to change your opinion at this stage, you will also have to come to terms with that fact that through your own mistakes you failed to buy bitcoin at prices probably 10x-100x cheaper than they currently are. This is the barrier to change of belief that you incorrectly accused me of.<p>> \"It does seem like your definition of \"understands Bitcoin\" is \"agrees with you\", so that's not particularly compelling as an argument.\"<p>It's true. The fact is that bitcoin presents itself on the surface as a combination of \"Ponzi scheme\" alarms bells, combined with massive, wasteful energy use. Most people see this and believe that they've seen through the hype that the dumb people have fallen for and walk away, albeit a bit disgruntled about the waste of energy that is affecting everyone.<p>They'll probably think things like, \"I couldn't really care less about this crypto rubbish, but at least do it in an energy efficient way like [insert random shitcoin here].<p>Almost every bitcoiner has been there, even Michael Saylor!. It actually takes a deep insight into a number of widely differing areas of knowledge/expertise to see the whole picture (which also involves see though some of the nonsense of traditional finance/Keynesian economics) and only then does it make sense, and only when it makes sense does it become an excellent use of energy, rather than a waste of energy. If you miss one piece of the jigsaw, it's an enormous waste of energy. So far every point you have made against bitcoin is one that I also made at one point along my learning curve but after 1000's of hours of deeper learning and contemplation, have realised they were wrong.<p>So, let's just start with the first of my misconceptions and at least agree on the facts, rather than any conjecture, before continuing on :\"Miners don't validate the transactions ($100 nodes people can run at home do that)\"<p>> \"Bitcoin proves chain validity using a system called proof of work\"\nOkay, so proof of work doesn't prove anything other than work. The chain validity is proven by the global network of low-cost nodes that check the chain (including the claimed proof of work) against the rules of bitcoin, defined by the individual node itself. \nIf a miner \"mines\" a block of transactions in a way that doesn't conform to bitcoin as defined by my node, those transactions didn't happen (according to me). If someone makes a change that I believe is detrimental enough to bitcoin that I'm willing to take a stand, then I won't apply the change to my node. Assuming I'm correct in my opinion, other bitcoiners will likely do the same and ultimately the network will split into two separate networks of nodes/miners, the best of which will ultimately win. This was seen in the \"block-size wars\" (were you on the side of the big-blockers?), which showed that the miners can mine according to which ever rules they like, but their work will be ignored by people who think those rules make bitcoin weaker/worse and the work will ultimately be wasted if those people were correct.<p>> \"To be fair, it is true that individual nodes can validate whether or not a proposed chain is completely incorrect, but so heckin what\"<p>So you agree to certain point, but not that the nodes have any power in defining what bitcoin is.  Does my explanation above, including the outcome of the \"block-size wars\" change that belief in any way?<p>> \"The important part is that the network specifically trusts whatever the longest blockchain is, and that entire security system is based on the entire network constantly racing itself to increase the chain's length.\"<p>I agree, but will qualify that the nodes on the network only trust the longest blockchain that confirms to the rules that the nodes' chosen code defines. If my node says the new longest chain is not bitcoin, then it's not bitcoin and I ignore it.<p>> \"The inefficiency is the point, the point is that the network can spend more energy than you individually can. It outspends your access to compute power. \"The network outspends your attack\" is basically the definition of a proof of work blockchain. So at a purely technical level, your explanation here already has issues. But let's ignore that and talk about economics:\"<p>So I agree on the fundamental point of \"the network outspends your attack\". But I don't agree that this makes it inefficient and I don't see how it highlights issues in my explanation (could you elaborate?)\nTo me the question of a system's efficiency is \"does this system solve the problem while using the lowest amount of energy possible?\". And so we first need to agree on what problem bitcoin is solving, before we can determine whether it's efficient or not. If you agree with what I've written in my other points above, then we can move on to that, but let's just get the facts about the blockchain straightened out and agreed on first.</p>"},{"id":"f98346d00a52597a","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by onlyrealcuzzo in \"New York will plant trees using new tech to maximize foliage impact\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:16:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:16:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2080,"y":2252,"wires":[["e751abf8c5e0d4ad"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499133\n<hr>\n<p>Rents only go up if more people want to live somewhere - or, maybe short-term, if the government levies more taxes.<p>If you make everywhere nice, then you don't need to pay a premium to live somewhere nice.<p>Maybe you have to pay a miniscule amount more in property taxes.<p>You could just stop running trash & sewer service and let the city turn to garbage if you want lower rents.

A friend told me I'd gotten mentioned here so I thought I'd drop in and offer some explanation, hope that's okay!<p>It's still in very early development, I mostly put it up on github so I could show it to some friends and get some review on it - the 'revision 0' hardware in there was only ever intended as a minimum-viable prototype to prove the concept and let me get started on driver development.<p>As far as licensing goes, once it's more polished I'm planning on releasing it under some kind of open hardware license. I've no interest in making money off of it beyond hopefully selling a small run of them to recoup the cost of development. Right now, though, I'd strongly recommend against trying to build it or derive anything from it in its current state - the Revision 0 hardware was only ever intended as a minimum-viable product, it has a number of hardware bugs, and I may make some software-incompatible changes in the next revision.<p>Having said that, things are progressing well. Aforementioned hardware bugs aside, the initial bringup of the board was a success, it sends and receives packets as it should, but there's plenty on the to-do list for the next revision.<p>It's driver development that's the killer. The Classic Mac OS network stack is ... interesting ...

Frameworks in general make what you want to do easier to do, at least from a developer experience perspective.

Make sure to consult a doctor or physical therapist about cervical traction, it’s easy to overdo it without guidance.</p>"},{"id":"319f98a8723342fb","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by hackernewds in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:56:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:56:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6230,"y":2664,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499460\n<hr>\n<p>intrigued but wondering if this is a shameless plug</p>"},{"id":"7c9c556ec277d608","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by pjmlp in \"Ask HN: What are some unpopular technologies you wish people knew more about?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:55:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:55:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6843,"y":1171.1914046002203,"wires":[["ba0cf485e4eba87a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499459\n<hr>\n<p>Memory safe systems languages, including their uses before C and UNIX took off.</p>"},{"id":"a80f9ea0dd53ac25","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by pasc1878 in \"Turbo Pascal Turns 40\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:55:41 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:55:41 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-6352.0001220703125,"y":1339.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499458\n<hr>\n<p>It was 1st January 1999 (well sort of the banks didn't open until 3rd)<p>The conversion rate was taken at end of business on the day before and all DEM, FRF etc trades had to be converted over the next two days.</p>"},{"id":"d984432d30bfb5e7","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by tlogan in \"GCP Incidents\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:55:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 15:55:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8414.794544352419,"y":1075.762061090743,"wires":[["5ca951b2b64f9eb7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499457\n<hr>\n<p>All these cloud service providers have bugs and issues.<p>But the problem with Google is that their support seems somehow disconnected from the real world.

Rothbard, a famous anarchocapitalist, wrote extensively about why property rights don’t extend to slaveowners.<p>Unlike private households and businesses, public companies only exist due to licenses from the state. These include limitation on liability, protection for many types of property, and much, much more. The protections even extend to securities regulations; since public companies aren’t privately owned, there is a misalignment between incentives of owners and managers. The state sides with the owners by using force on managers to prevent them from acting in their own self interest, and instead to act on behalf of the shareholder public.<p>The NAP cannot extend to public companies as they are not privately owned and can only exist when granted rights by the state.

As a scientist reverse engineering the platform, here are some potential issues I noticed:<p>Hydrostatic Transmission Design:\nQuick Fix Approach: The hydrostatic transmission system might be perceived as a quick and simple solution to retrofit the tractor for electric power. This could lead to potential inefficiencies and compromised performance.\nIntegration Challenges: Retrofitting an existing platform for electric power requires careful consideration of how the hydrostatic transmission integrates with the electric motor and the overall power delivery system.\nWeight and Energy Loss:\nBattery Weight: Electric vehicles, including tractors, are often challenged by the weight of the batteries. If the Monarch tractor is not designed with lightweight yet powerful batteries, it may result in a heavy and less efficient vehicle.\nEnergy Loss: Dragging around the additional weight of both the tractor and the batteries can lead to energy losses, reducing overall efficiency. This compromises the tractor's ability to maximize energy conservation.\nOverall Energy Conservation:\nEnergy Transfer Efficiency: The energy transfer from the battery to the motor and subsequently to the wheels needs to be highly efficient. Since there are significant losses in this process, it can impact the overall performance and range of the electric tractor.\nSystem Integration and Optimization:\nComprehensive Engineering: For optimal performance, the entire electric powertrain, including the hydrostatic transmission, motor, and battery, must be re-engineered as a cohesive system. The lack of comprehensive engineering may result in suboptimal performance and reduced longevity of components.\nUser Experience and Agricultural Efficiency:\nFarmers' Needs: The tractor's design must consider the practical needs of farmers, including ease of use, maneuverability, and efficiency in performing agricultural tasks. A compromised vehicle may not meet the standards required for efficient farming operations.\nThus, addressing these engineering challenges requires a holistic approach to the design and integration of the electric powertrain. The hydrostatic transmission system should be carefully engineered to complement the electric motor and batteries, ensuring that the Monarch electric tractor delivers optimal performance, efficiency, and reliability in agricultural settings.\nOther problems:\nBased on the provided specifications for the Monarch MK-V 4-Wheel Drive tractor, here are some potential concerns or areas that might need further consideration:<p>Price Point:\nThe starting price of $88,998 might be a significant financial barrier for small or mid-sized farmers. Affordability could limit accessibility to a broader market.\nPower and Performance:\nThe peak motor power of 70 hp and rated power of 40 hp may be suitable for certain agricultural tasks, but the performance may not meet the requirements of more demanding or larger-scale operations.\nRun Time and Battery Life:\nThe estimated run time of 14 hours is useful, but the actual run time may vary based on farm conditions and operations. Concerns might arise regarding the battery life and the need for recharging during a workday.\nCharging Infrastructure:\nThe charging times of 5 to 6 hours with an 80 A charger and 10 to 12 hours with a 40 A charger might be considered lengthy by users. Availability and accessibility of charging infrastructure could be a concern.\nWeight:\nThe base weight of 5,750 lbs is a consideration for soil compaction. Farmers may seek information on how this weight affects field performance and soil health.\nIt's essential for Monarch to provide clear documentation, training, and real-world performance data to address potential concerns and instill confidence in the tractor's capabilities, especially given the significant investment required.</p>"},{"id":"ed51ded36a64d01b","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by hackernj in \"Alex Robey safeguards AI systems against malicious tampering with SmoothLLM\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:09:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:09:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5428.0001220703125,"y":3243.604736328125,"wires":[["abc28e4accb73605"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499570\n<hr>\n<p>“Think of SmoothLLM as a security protocol that scrutinizes each request made to the LLM.

It's very similar to Markdown (MD) so it's never bothered me, but I know some people get very annoyed at the \"uncanny valley\" between reST and MD. reST has some very powerful yet simple features; it perplexes me that these aren't adopted in other docs systems.

Phrasing them in a full computational language is either overkill or has some dangerous edge cases, or both.<p>As an example, I'm sure there are some who wish that Terraform was in a more scriptable format and there are instances when that would be very useful, but it would make maintaining the whole ecosystem significantly harder, static analysis would be more difficult for sure, and when necessary you can always drop down into golang to define a custom resource or call terraform in a loop as terragrunt does.. so the additional power isn't completely missing.<p>I've worked with configuration formats that had too much power allotted to them, it isn't worth it.

This way you can start to recognize patterns in your thinking and begin to rewire your reactions to disturbing circumstances.<p>Conversations are stored in markdown files on your local machine, ensuring privacy and portability while giving you the freedom to organize your sessions as you please. You could easily share these files with a therapist.<p>I built this for myself when I noticed the patterns of chat help I was getting from my therapist in between therapy sessions was essentially coaching that didn't require much context beyond the immediate situation and emotions. This felt like a particularly good use case for LLMs.<p>ChatCBT has been pretty effective for me to talk myself through spiraling episodes of negative thinking. I've been able to get back on my horse faster, and it's convenient that it's available 24/7 and 5000x cheaper than a therapy session (or free if using Ollama).

I need to have enough energy to be productive instead of being always in survival mode.<p>I was born in a place where I do not belong. I am not a cultural, a (un)theological, or even linguistic fit. I knew it from a very early age and so I left - 13 years ago... and have been on the \"run\" since. I've only gone back to renew my passport - physical presence being a requirement.<p>I bare no ill-will against any individual. Group-think is a powerful phenomenon. Perhaps the most difficult part of it all is being aware of what I shared above. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be a little bit less \"exposed\" if you would.<p>I've traveled, I've volunteered, I picked up \"side jobs\" and I've learned. It's just that every time I manage to get the slightest progress towards stability, the waves come crashing down - I've learned to accept that as a fact of life.<p>\"Move away from the waves\" - Someone, somewhere.<p>I long for a simple life. A roof, just enough sustenance, and a basic connection to the internet. I have no desire for anything else. I have found my calling and all I need is just enough stability to be able to work on creating it - which I have been doing for the last 16 months, but it's immeasurably hard to allocate any energy towards it when I'm on basement 2 on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. I say this with no hesitation, but I would be 100% content supporting my existence and working on my calling for the next 10 years exclusively. I have found joy. I just need to eliminate the noise.<p>And so I find myself writing this, for reasons I don't understand yet. Stranded at an airport somewhere in the east of the globe as I have been for the last few months. I have gotten better at acting like everything is fine in public, but when the night comes, there's no escaping the fact that I have been \"homeless\".

I'll start off by saying, no shade to the AoC people, and I greatly appreciate and respect their efforts. Just pointing it out.<p>The intended meaning is that in each game, a set of red, green, and blue cubes is taken out of the bag, replaced, another set is taken out, and so on until the game ends. I think nothing in the example contradicts the meaning that all sets listed for the game are taken out and replaced as a group. That is, these are mutually exclusive subsets of the bag's contents. The example only shows games that are strictly valid or invalid for both interpretations. It didn't show a game that had individually valid sets but a sum of some color that exceeded the maximum. For example,<p>Game N: 4 red, 5 blue, 4 green; 3 green, 2 blue, 7 red; 2 blue, 8 red<p>would require at least 19 red cubes by my initially understood meaning. This can be disproved from the part 2 description, but I was on part 1 at the time.</p>"},{"id":"7e2716993c241a9d","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by m_sahaf in \"GCP Incidents\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:47:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:47:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8414.794544352419,"y":1235.762061090743,"wires":[["5ca951b2b64f9eb7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499873\n<hr>\n<p>I don't know what metric to use of \"good\", but the throwaway app I've used it for worked flawlessly with both, so good enough for me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>"},{"id":"cbe7d30b70bfccab","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by tacticalturtle in \"Playstation removing previously purchased Discovery content\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:46:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:46:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4936.0001220703125,"y":3035.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499872\n<hr>\n<p>Fortunately at least “Happy Birthday” is in the public domain as of 2016.</p>"},{"id":"b682d4a9745ef561","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by pjmlp in \"Is Ada safer than Rust?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:46:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:46:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5390.0001220703125,"y":835.604736328125,"wires":[["6f88ac393a50c9ee"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499871\n<hr>\n<p>Sadly it suffered from high prices, and being extra tooling even on UNIX SDKs, until GNAT came to be.<p>Still, not all languages can assert having 7 commercial vendors in business, lasting 40 years and counting.</p>"},{"id":"4539c4f59c868af1","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by wongarsu in \"Tiny Volumetric Display\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:46:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:46:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2758.0001220703125,"y":1379.604736328125,"wires":[["19f5a0207b9f2442"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499870\n<hr>\n<p>I sometimes see them at trade fairs as an eye catcher.

The pattern I've found useful is to have the same number assigned for Eyebrowse workspace and terminal, so `Alt+n` opens my nth project in terminal and in emacs.<p>For the features/tickets that I'm working on, I use an org file to note down my thoughts, subtasks, blockers, and also the status (TODO/DONE/IN-PROGRESS) etc. It's synced with my org's Google Drive, while the rest of my personal org files get synced to iCloud. Any topics for 1-1 with my peers/managers also get noted and synced.<p>There was a time in my previous job where I was using emails for discussions, and back then I had tight integration with Mu4e too. I've dabbled with Jira/Slack modes but they're not worth the hassle.<p>I'm the only one using Emacs in my org, and I feel fine doing it. Pairing works fine since the driver uses their editor of choice.</p>"},{"id":"1148824a172d366e","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Bologna's leaning tower sealed off over fears it could collapse","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:51:41 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:51:41 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4888.0001220703125,"y":1499.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67599067\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67599067</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499906\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499906</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"c965e97b69fc676f","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Swapping blood for spit – for convenient at-home health monitoring","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:50:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:50:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5336.0001220703125,"y":1659.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2023/november/swapping-blood-for-spit-for-convenient-at-home-health-monitoring.html\">https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2023/november/swapping-blood-for-spit-for-convenient-at-home-health-monitoring.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499897\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499897</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"7eb95f4493597173","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"A Decade of Advancing the in AI Through Open Research","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:50:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:50:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5904.0001220703125,"y":1339.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/decade-of-advancing-ai-through-open-research/\">https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/decade-of-advancing-ai-through-open-research/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499895\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499895</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"c9a2d95d615438ab","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Ask HN: Why was Elon Musk forced to buy Twitter?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:49:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:49:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5590.221059218038,"y":20,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>It feels like they forced him to buy it, and now they are tarring and feathering him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499891\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499891</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>"},{"id":"f54c28843b8733c4","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by imtringued in \"A medieval Gothic monastery built using CAD / CAM\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:58:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:58:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2580,"y":4316,"wires":[["7b8e9cc8fea20710"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499951\n<hr>\n<p>That is kind of sad.

According to testing I experience an apnea around 100 times an hour, and I wake up for 90 of those. On top of this I have a certain amount of agoraphobia and I completely shut down in stressful situations, which has prevented me from seeking UC and disability support payments. My job let me go last year, despite their assurances that they were disability friendly, so I've had to move back in with my parents which while it saves me from homelessness, means I'm without any social support that would help me through applying for UC. I am waiting for second stage triage for ADHD medication and for the local GIC to get back to me, both of which are six+ months away (it could be a year or longer, even).<p>I'm currently coasting on savings, which means I have approximately 100 quid left, and it has to last me for the next six months or longer. What I'd like is enough money to get an indoor cycle (even a shitty, broken cycle would be sufficient), so I can have the human equivalent of a hamster wheel to help get my blood pressure down so they will actually be inclined to prescribe ADHD medication when the time comes. Anything more will go towards private appointments for an ADHD diagnosis, which will hopefully allow me access to non-stimulant ADHD medication (which is not prescribed under the NHS), which will help me get back into work.<p>This entire situation feels extremely crushing, maybe posting here is a bit of a long shot.

The guard helps a bit mainly from damage when asleep and seems to protect my jaw joints.<p>My point being even if my jaw is totally relaxed there is a hum from the muscles in my jaw. It's like a 60Hz hum musicians hear from AC interference in speakers. I have to wonder if it's part of the constant noise I hear in my ears.<p>I also get BPPV too it's severe sudden vertigo it may be related to my clench and tinnitus. It's just random no clue what causes it. I can't even walk and have to lay down and not even close  my eyes just pick a spot and stare. I had to do that for 12 hours one time my worst time.</p>"},{"id":"f0b2d732c75b4ce2","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by nshkr in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:56:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:56:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6230,"y":2920,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38499932\n<hr>\n<p>T and H are major factors for ruining my life.

Pb is nasty stuff, but the purported risks have been inflated beyond what's actually grounded in solid evidence.<p>The term \"Pb poisoning\" has two different meanings: traditionally it's referred to blood lead levels above about 50 mcg/dL, at which demonstrable symptoms occur (slowed reaction times, etc). But in recent decades, it's also used to describe much lower levels (>15 mcg/dL, >10 mcg/dL, or even >5 mcg/dL), for which the only evidence of harm comes from observational studies.<p>Observational studies establish correlation, not causation, and there are good reasons to doubt that the observed correlations are due to Pb neurotoxicity. The relationship between Pb exposure and cognitive/behavioral outcomes is intractably complicated, because for most children Pb exposure is primarily from dirt/dust ingestion, which in turn correlates with a child's developmental status, household cleanliness, and subtle aspects of parenting behaviors (in addition of course to more widely appreciated factors like age/condition of the home). Poor nutrition also causes higher BLLs.<p>It's been demonstrated that publication bias in the Pb literature has steadily risen over time, as reported effect sizes have increased. Several studies have found Pb correlations which resemble a U curve, where children with the highest blood lead levels have better cognitive/behavioral outcomes than those with intermediate BLLs (because outside the range of BLLs which are primarily driven by dirt/dust ingestion, \"something else is going on\", which doesn't correlate as well with cognitive/behavioral outcomes).<p>Dirt/dust ingestion (and therefore, BLLs) drop precipitously around age 2, because this is around the time when children outgrow mouthing behavior - some children a bit earlier, some children a bit later. BLL measurements at this age therefore a metric of developmental status. Or alternatively, this is the age at which \"lead causes the most harm\".<p>My argument is of course not that you should go paint your child's nursery with chrome yellow. Ingesting paint chips can be enough to put a child into the \"actual lead poisoning\" BLL range (drinking water from lead pipes generally cannot). But excluding exposure from leaded gasoline (which was formerly the dominant source of exposure, but which has fortunately been banned almost everywhere) and people living near smelting facilities, it's probably not the scary ubiquitous IQ-point larcenist that it's made out to be.</p>"},{"id":"ad8e7c1c21eecd0f","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by roamerz in \"No new boss at NSA until it answers questions on buying location, browsing data\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:21:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:21:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3170,"y":4448,"wires":[["6ad5b917121b90be"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500122\n<hr>\n<p>>Yeah, I know.

If you truly need all the advantages of native performance and integration, just go native. Yes, you'll need to \"write it twice\", but you'll find that it's actually easier to hire top notch iOS or Android devs in the first place (in my experience they tend to be partisans) with high productivity.<p>2. I think the biggest thing that has changed since React Native first came on the scene is that the <i>browser-based</i> cross-platform toolkits, things like the Capacitor  framework (and starting with Progressive Web Apps in the first place), have gotten much better, and browser tech now gives loads of access to underlying devices and sensors (accelerometer, cameras, biometrics, etc.) React Native really came out with the idea of \"I've got all these web devs, can I make them productive on native mobile?\" I think things like Capacitor and their ilk are a much better option for this issue now.<p>So in my opinion, if you really need native, use the native frameworks, but if your app doesn't need that and you can do cross-platform, use one of the web-view-based cross-platform frameworks.</p>"},{"id":"b1a256c82ad3302d","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by galangalalgol in \"Is Ada safer than Rust?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:45:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:45:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5390.0001220703125,"y":975.604736328125,"wires":[["6f88ac393a50c9ee"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500318\n<hr>\n<p>Your last point is the largest thing I noticed in the one large codebase I looked at.

By having the main functions before the private, and then having any number of simple or complex private implementation functions, we make it clear to the reader what the contract is.  If the functions are well-named, the reader can just read up to the private and stop.  They will understand what is going on without having to know any of the \"how\" details.  That's a very good thing.  In fact, we well written system using this approach can be read and understood by less technical people (also a good thing, for many reasons).<p>Whether the contents of do_this_specific_thing() are just one line or 100 lines, that point is that we don't have to know or care.  We just know that do_this_specific_thing presumably does what its name says, and we accept that and don't worry about HOW.<p>When you inline those tiny functions, as the author argues for, now the reader has to recognize what each implementation line means.  Of course we might say it's obvious, but it's less consistent and clear than a series of calls to functions which are well-named and take arguments which are well-named.<p>And as software engineers of any experience, we know that eventually one of those \"simple\" actions will become more complex due to some new requirements.  Then that one line becomes more lines, and then of course it will end up as its own function.  Over time, many of those simple steps will become more complex out of necessity, and eventually we'll end up with all those individual private methods (with bigger bodies).<p>As for maintaining state, I personally argue against any OOP style.  All of those action functions can just be functions in an appropriately-named module.  They should all take input arguments (the data), and ideally not even mutate the input but rather return a value.  That value could be a new version of the input data (can be memory/time expensive, so not always the best choice), or they can be just a data structure of changes.<p>I'm not a fan of lambdas, however, as they require more human memory to keep track of what's going on in a system.</p>"},{"id":"12cd620e90058a66","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by gmuslera in \"Generative AI is killing our sense of awe\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:56:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:56:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5612.69227260944,"y":5099.664861718347,"wires":[["c71c4a1ae2227e28"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500425\n<hr>\n<p>This is mostly about AI generated images, not ChatGPT and alike that still put us to the ground on our expectations.<p>And I agree that a lot that can be generated in images with simple prompts is awesome. The problem is that is comparable or even better than the “old” awesome made by expensive artists. So, it was so awesome that old art if I can generate something even better with a short prompt?<p>I have 3 readings on that: AIs are standing on the shoulders of giants, most of “art” was not so much the work of genius but something more or less mechanical on remixing memes and cultural trends, and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the watcher is as responsible for the “art” as the artist as much of the magic happens in his head, and that is independent from how the image was generated.<p>In any case, I think we didn’t lost our sense of awe. I can generate a thousand pictures with simple prompts and think they are amazing, even to have a healthy effect on my by watching them. But the artificial scarcity and market that used to be around images may end.</p>"},{"id":"de638e486255375a","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by mlyle in \"10,000TB storage cartridges could become mainstream by 2030\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:56:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 17:56:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6674.450368074487,"y":3738.1364641536793,"wires":[["6ec425345be64895"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500423\n<hr>\n<p>> My understanding from the video is that it's a write-once solution,<p>If you have enough capacity, write-once is enough.
