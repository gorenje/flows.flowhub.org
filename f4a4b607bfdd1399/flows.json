I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.<p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?<p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496357\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496357</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>"},{"id":"cae687973559e035","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Ask HN: Which Wireless Carriers Protect Against SIM Swapping & Port-Out Attacks?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 05:56:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 05:56:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4983.5366260102455,"y":6286.415562826311,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>I've been a Google Fi customer for a long time, and one of the pros is that you need to log in to your Google Account to make service changes (plus getting a hold of support is difficult, which is good in this context). However, I'm trying to move away from Google services and want to use Fastmail on iOS instead of Gmail on Android, but Google Fi requires the use of a Google account (e.g. for the Fi app, which provides critical functionality IIUC).<p>So to make a long-story short, I'm looking for another wireless carrier, but I'm concerned about SIM-swapping attacks (I know, I shouldn't be using SMS-based 2FA, but many services fallback to it and don't allow this to be disabled).<p>So, which carriers offer some kind of protection against SIM swapping, ideally something more than a 4-digit PIN that's texted to you (looking at you Mint)?

You can read it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34122118<p>Last year we were able to provide nearly $20k worth of support to community members. I know things have only gotten more challenging since then for a number of us, so I wanted to make sure I provided more time this year for people to reach out.<p>As usual, this is not a request for donations. Last year and this year I am content to finance this operation myself (although a number of people did step up and offer additional support). All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.<p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds. Reasonable requests include:<p>- Holiday housing<p>- Toys/gifts for family members<p>- Food<p>- Travel assistance<p>- Medical expenses<p>- Entertainment for the family<p>I understand, as a formerly homeless person myself, that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us.<p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.<p>Happy holidays!<p>- Alexander</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

I’m more surprised that petapixel didn’t do a more thoughtful evaluation rather than perpetuating the story.</p>"},{"id":"dabfa254ed6b9b32","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by supriyo-biswas in \"Not Everything Is Google's Fault (Just Many Things)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:50:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:50:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1450,"y":1868,"wires":[["5ca951b2b64f9eb7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497136\n<hr>\n<p>Company lawyers like flexing their muscles regardless of the actual legality of such agreements or clauses.<p>As an example, in India, non-competes are outright illegal since the Indian Contracts Act directly states that any clauses in a contract restraining a lawful profession or trade will be disregarded, and yet most companies out there will add a non-compete clause.</p>"},{"id":"18fe4d1e9f20a585","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Get access to a curated group of discounted tools for your SaaS with 1 sub","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:53:28 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:53:28 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3143.9998779296875,"y":1747.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://discount-box.lab107.dev/\">https://discount-box.lab107.dev/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497149\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497149</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"596d6df13e4de09d","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Show HN: Advent of Code CLI","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:52:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:52:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2591.9998779296875,"y":971.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/tobias-walle/advent-of-code-cli\">https://github.com/tobias-walle/advent-of-code-cli</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497143\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497143</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"493fe9de06446a92","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Bridging the Expertise Gap in B2B Tech Sales","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:50:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:50:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3519.9998779296875,"y":1019.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.revgenius.com/mag/bridging-the-expertise-gap-in-b2b-tech-sales/\">https://www.revgenius.com/mag/bridging-the-expertise-gap-in-b2b-tech-sales/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497135\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497135</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"f863b1bb1943946d","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"The Cybertruck Is a Disappointment Even to Cybertruck Superfans","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:49:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:49:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2515.9998779296875,"y":1451.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a35ed/the-cybertruck-is-a-disappointment-even-to-cybertruck-superfans\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a35ed/the-cybertruck-is-a-disappointment-even-to-cybertruck-superfans</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497132\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497132</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"ba0b5eccc240b0fc","type":"subflow:e9acd6fab869f4db","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"Guys, have I gone too far?

They also built a lot of reactors in the highly seismic area of west Alps, but if something happened to any of them, the winds would carry the spicy cloud to Switzerland, Italy or Germany.</p>"},{"id":"8d303368506b52bd","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by beebeepka in \"Cocoa harvested by kids as young as 5 in Ghana: CBS News investigation\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:56:03 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:56:03 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2007.9998779296875,"y":2915.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497161\n<hr>\n<p>Following this brilliant logic, almost everyone involved in education does not work with kids because \"it is impossible\".<p>I know exactly what OP meant and it was just grandpa talk.
