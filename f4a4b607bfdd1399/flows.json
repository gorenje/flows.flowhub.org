You can read it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34122118<p>Last year we were able to provide nearly $20k worth of support to community members. I know things have only gotten more challenging since then for a number of us, so I wanted to make sure I provided more time this year for people to reach out.<p>As usual, this is not a request for donations. Last year and this year I am content to finance this operation myself (although a number of people did step up and offer additional support). All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.<p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds. Reasonable requests include:<p>- Holiday housing<p>- Toys/gifts for family members<p>- Food<p>- Travel assistance<p>- Medical expenses<p>- Entertainment for the family<p>I understand, as a formerly homeless person myself, that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us.<p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.<p>Happy holidays!<p>- Alexander</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

I downloaded a few apk program/files to get a certain Youtube version. The first apk was a certain apk for app patches called revanced manager. The seconded apk was YouTube blue apk v18.45.41from Youtubevanced.org. After Clicking the second download link on the web a downloading prompt showed up in the middle of my screen showing the YouTube blue v18.45.41apk was downloading after it had downloaded the prompt didn't go away but immediately gave the option to update the YouTube app so I clicked update which it did then after the prompt finished showing me it that it was done updating the prompt again didn't go away but gave me the option to open the YouTube app which I did. However after it didn't go to YouTube it redirected me to another site for a apk file called vanced micro g- to download. With out vanced micro g the apk programs/files I downloaded would be useless, So I downloaded it. (since the files require each other to create a program. If I didn't download the YouTube version to came to life) Promt shows up that's it's downloading and finishes and goes away. And instead of the youtube app that's already on my device being updated- the youtube thats already one my device which was here first wasn't updated and hasn't been updated but however a second youtube icon comes up that's a different version and is second YouTube app that now works the way I want. Except I'm not signed anymore. When I open the YouTube app the features work fine and the way I want but I'm not signed into my youtube accout. So I click sign in add account and am directed to a page that says<p>\"An app on your device is trying to sign into a google account. If this was intentional, use the sign in (or Huawei, if you have device with brand) button to connect to Google sign page, if not, press cancel to go back to the application that cuased this dialogue to show up.\"<p>Will my Google account get compromised. I have alot incorporated with my Google account like debit card info, linked webpages for account sign in, personal files, contacts, ECT. Has anyone had there private info/data stolen from signing into too your google account through vanced micro g for youtube version 18.45.41? Or have you not been breached since signing in?<p>I'm also thinking it's asking me that because I was signed into the YouTube account by connecting with Google option, when I signed up for youtube i didnt enter a email and new password, i just linked it with google.<p>Iv read alot about people using wordology as the word vanced myself and the and the three sylibles of \"micro g\" online but never once \"VANCED MICRO G\" four sylibles all together explaining anything. Iv read about people signing into vanced but I that could an abbreviation for revanced manger or something.

There are several, including hearing loss, which (as someone here points out) possibly produces tinnitus in a manner similar to how limb loss can cause phantom limb pain. The nervous system isn't like plumbing, it's a tangled web of self-adjusting feedback loops. Once an input is severed, an area of the tangled web may lose an important calibrating input. Neurons don't emit \"noise signals\" (or \"pain signals\" or whatever)  they just depolarise in response to stimulation, and altered calibration alters which neurons depolarise and how often. The frequency and number of certain neurons depolarising is experienced as noise (or pain or whatever) by the conscious human they belong to.<p>Good talk here[0] BUT BE WARNED, I recall* that there's a high-pitched squeal during this talk as a demonstration of what tinnitus is like for done people. It's extremely nasty especially if you're wearing headphones.<p>Incidentally, the self-adjusting feedback loop model helps explain why things like wiggling your jaw can alter the experience of tinnitus. Due to wiring issues, sensory input from muscles and joints can get mixed in with the auditory inputs. A similar mechanism (which isn't fully understood) helps explain why, for example, people having a heart attack can experience pain in the left arm. There's nothing wrong with the arm, the normal sensory signals from the arm are mixing with those from the heart.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=XGq3MXQlRJs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=XGq3MXQlRJs</a><p>* Can't verify right now, trusting my memory.</p>"},{"id":"d61ae0ae386cb968","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by phendrenad2 in \"Chrome's next weapon in the War on Ad Blockers: Slower extension updates\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1382.0577392578125,"y":3465.928140640259,"wires":[["f9b1f67c51b74599"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497678\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"fa41cd2df9ec4dfe","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by jonathanlydall in \"Google Maps now looks more like Apple Maps – and a lot of people aren't happy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:32 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2010,"y":6448,"wires":[["9d3df73e6a74d3f6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497677\n<hr>\n<p>More and more I'm seeing headlines suffixed similar to the above \"...and a lot of people aren't happy\" or \"...and people are upset\" and it just seems to me like shoddy work by article authors.<p>These kinds of headlines make me assume the article is not going to bother to give a balanced or researched analysis, but instead just talk about how people are feeling about things, without necessarily quantifying anything.<p>It's okay to have feelings or opinions, but that's generally pretty useless to other people without some rationalization or justification as to why you have them.<p>I would have been far more inclined to read an article with a headline like \"Google updates its Maps to look more like Apple's at the expense of ease of use\".</p>"},{"id":"197fa01f45738b89","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by nvm0n2 in \"Star neuroscientist may have manipulated data to support a major stroke trial\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 10:55:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":795.9998779296875,"y":3003.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497676\n<hr>\n<p>Very substantial, to the extent that the dataset was made up.

Often it implements session using cookies, which given the state you were in previously. Maybe you wanted to embed the login page on your own site (iframe or webview), now the cookies are flagged as third party cookies and blocked in a variety of context.<p>Especially in an app context it becomes a minefield of half baked webview implementations, browser specific quirks, and limitations on how to call back to the host app which initiated the flow.<p>Other questions are how do we handle return urls, i.e. return to where we started the login flow from? there isn't a good answer in oidc, unless you use some of the more extreme flows. It becomes tricky to implement without opening yourself to open redirect attacks, which kind of voids the benefits of oidc (that you don't have to handle the complexity of the authentication).<p>Also there are endless variations of the oidc flow, the most common being code flow, which is pretty much what you describe. But it gets increasingly complex as you have to handle native app login (PKCE pronounced pixie). Using these flows you end up becoming as much an expert in the technology as you would've been just implementing authentication and identity yourself.</p>"},{"id":"d873c76edabc6f49","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by JCharante in \"Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?

So in this model academic scientists develop a foundation of firm and rigorous theory about how nature works, publish a literature on it for the good of all mankind, and then shorter term applied research is done by companies to derive practical insights from that literature.<p>That model doesn't seem right, because there are lots of corporate research programmes into fundamental theory that were/are lavishly funded despite a decade+ of no ROI, most obviously at the moment AI. But let's put that aside and pretend it's true.<p>Problem is that humanities and social studies don't produce a body of theory on which anything can be built. Humanities produces only critical theory, which despite the name is more like a belief system than a scientific theory. The social studies produce a lot of that too, but even outside critical theory their output is just a giant pile of random thought bubbles and mini-studies to try and prove them. There's nothing much linking these studies, no frameworks that make reliable new predictions. Instead we get an endless stream of Just So claims that fall apart when people try to replicate them, but even failure to replicate doesn't have any impact because there's nothing underneath them to be invalidated. At most it's shown that this one specific paper isn't reliable.<p>Contrast to something like physics where the work of academic theorists is all about coming up with unified theories of everything, which could then be used to develop practical applications. Einstein is super famous because he invalidated large swathes of theory and opened up space for new theory to be developed. Social studies don't have any equivalent to Einstein and can't by design.</p>"},{"id":"b92f0fe5f0701519","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by gumballindie in \"Google Maps now looks more like Apple Maps – and a lot of people aren't happy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:15:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:15:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2010,"y":6640,"wires":[["9d3df73e6a74d3f6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497773\n<hr>\n<p>Google needs to have a serious review of their product management hiring practices.

built-in ad blocking, though some dislike its use of cryptocurrency.\nFirefox is only decent tier due to its many annoying default features, but can be excellent with the right privacy-focused user.js file.\nIcecat is decent tier for free software purists due to its use of LibreJS blocking non-free scripts, though this breaks many sites.\nLibrewolf is excellent tier as an easy to use private version of Firefox without much configuration needed.\nChromium-based browsers like Vivaldi can be good but have limitations from not being fully open source.\nClosed source browsers like Chrome, Edge and Opera are automatically placed in spyware tier due to privacy concerns.\nQutebrowser is decent tier for power users due to its keyboard-focused design but has issues with advanced ad blocking.\nWaterfox is excellent tier as a lightweight Firefox fork, though its ownership by an ad company concerns some.\nOverall, Brave, Librewolf and hardened Firefox are recommended as having the best balance of privacy, usability and customizability.</p>"},{"id":"3f37aae50d305ae0","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by perrygeo in \"The Revenge of the

All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us).

The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.<p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?<p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website.

Both OpenID Connect, Keycloak and configuring mod_auth_openidc.<p>Right now I'm moving permissions/roles back into the app DB, because I don't want to have to work with the Keycloak REST API every time I want to change what a user can or cannot do in the system, in addition to permissions which might only apply conditionally (one user might be related to multiple organizations, having different permissions in the context of each).<p>Regardless, it's nice that there are more pieces of software out there to choose from!

Had to go a bit into debt to fund moving into the dorm initially and never exactly recovered from that debt, just hovering with nothing really changing.<p>Recently lost access to my student loan as I am too slow to study for their requirements but I've managed to offset that by working as sysadmin/tech support at a small uni lab. My main sources of income being this job, \"child benefits\", and a half-orphan pension (lost my mom to alcohol when I was 15, dad remarried later). This half-orphan pension now _also_ fell off until I have the paperwork handled to re-request it after they asked me for proof that I've been studying two years ago, which I sent in too late. This pension also covered healthcare automatically.<p>Now with my pension out of the picture until they process it I have been thrown into the regular healthcare system, which added a monthly expense that I was not prepared for, especially because they are also requesting that I retroactively pay up for 3 months of apparently missed contributions/fees. Sent them an email a few days ago asking if it was possible to pay this off in monthly rates to hopefully make it a bit more manageable, but they have a very archaic policy of not responding to emails and only sending out paper mail. I also tried calling but the person I talked to wasn't exactly helpful outside of \"have you tried sending an email\".\nI am honestly at a bit of a loss as to how to approach this.<p>There were some pipe dreams of finding more work but the job market is, excuse the expression, fucked. Nobody would employ a student who hasn't finished their bachelor's yet. I'll probably try to find a job at some fastfood place or grocery store next and put my studies on pause. This might bite me back later because of credit point requirements from my course but still better than having debt collectors on my ass.<p>I understand that this is all over the place. It would mean the world to me if someone could even find the time to chime in and give some advice.</p>"},{"id":"43d812886c720fa1","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by idonotknowwhy in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:41:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:41:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":910,"y":5116,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497892\n<hr>\n<p>Yeah okay, that must be something different (that I can't do) then.</p>"},{"id":"637f6b63b2bcf12c","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by collyw in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:41:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:41:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":910,"y":5148,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497891\n<hr>\n<p>Earplugs often give me tinnitus when I am wearing them.</p>"},{"id":"b93aab96c5f9c6a1","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by danielhanchen in \"Show HN: 80% faster, 50% less memory, 0% loss of accuracy Llama finetuning\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:40:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 11:40:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-560.0001220703125,"y":3499.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497890\n<hr>\n<p>Hmm the main issue sounds like the market capture is limited - I highly disagree bigtech companies have achieved what we already have - maybe OpenAI or other AI companies might have done it - but it's all \"might\" have.<p>I worked myself in the past at NVIDIA making algos faster, so it's not a done deal big tech companies have all the tips and tricks.

It’s a strange prejudice that would have been foreign to the builders and architects of the original gothic cathedrals. These were people who were at the cutting edge of architectural technology and skill, certainly the cutting edge in Europe, not people who romanticized “being artisanal”. Frankly, the sophistication of gothic architecture rivals much of what we build today in many respects.<p>We also suffer from the strange, progressive, prejudiced belief that older styles are “anachronistic” if  used today. They’re just styles. What does time have to do with anything? Architectural developments since the middle ages might change how we build such architecture or remove what had previously been a constraint imposed by the methods of the day (note the neogothic), but the essential character can remain the same…or it can undergo development.<p>I think that the availability of  CNC machines makes architecturally beauty all the more accessible.

Two common metrics are precision and recall. Precision in the context of maps would be that everything you see is highly relevant. It's not. Random selection of crap I don't care about would be the friendliest thing to say about it. Recall would be that if it is there, you should be able to find it by zooming in. It fails hard with that too. Google maps is neither very precise or very good at recalling things. It used to be better at this.<p>Not showing the street names is a problem. Filtering out business I know exist and that I know they have is a problem. Bakeries, bars, coffee places, etc. They have them all. But not on the map. And it's not like there is a lot of other content competing for attention when fully zoomed in. I live in the middle of Berlin, not in a freaking desert.<p>Only when I search for them do they show up. Showing me nothing where I know they have stuff is a choice. A bad one. It's all form over function lately at Google. Lipstick on a pig. And it doesn't even look that good. Hating the bright greens particularly. Fugly as hell. But Apple does it so it must be good. I guess imitation is a form of flattery. Or desperation. Or something. But it's definitely imitation.<p>It indeed looks like nobody is in charge, as Ian Hickson suggested in the article that was on HN last week when he left Google after 16 years. Indecisiveness and a lack of leadership are on full display here. Nobody calling BS on this is a problem. Leadership allowing this out of the door, or worse, insisting it is released in this form, is a problem. I guess somebody needed their Christmas bonus so they shipped \"something\" and forced it through. Just speculating here but corporate stupidity tends to work like that. It's not hard to make an educated guess at the multiple levels of mundane stupidity at play here from the outside. Because I've seen it from the inside in other companies.</p>"},{"id":"f8cc03851dd6be16","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by idonotknowwhy in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:09:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:09:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":910,"y":5468,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498031\n<hr>\n<p>Same here, what the hell?
