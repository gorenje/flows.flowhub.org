However it's concerning that it happened at all, as all the ips were Cloudflare ips, e.g.:<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>172.69.90.116 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>108.162.221.143 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.235.85 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.110.143 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.110.142 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.22 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 301 244<p>(it was around 5800 requests per second to a site that normally gets 1 request per second or less at this time of day, and lasted 21.5 minutes).<p>As it is http, I don't think it could have been spoofed. I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.<p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?<p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

thread a bit earlier this year.<p>Last year we had an incredible response to a thread offering assistance to those in the HN community. You can read it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34122118<p>Last year we were able to provide nearly $20k worth of support to community members. I know things have only gotten more challenging since then for a number of us, so I wanted to make sure I provided more time this year for people to reach out.<p>As usual, this is not a request for donations. Last year and this year I am content to finance this operation myself (although a number of people did step up and offer additional support). All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.<p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds. Reasonable requests include:<p>- Holiday housing<p>- Toys/gifts for family members<p>- Food<p>- Travel assistance<p>- Medical expenses<p>- Entertainment for the family<p>I understand, as a formerly homeless person myself, that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us.<p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.<p>Happy holidays!<p>- Alexander</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Solar does not help either when snow covers the panels which look out over a steely-gray snow-laden sky (source: I just looked out of the window) nor does wind (source: same the before).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gerhard-schroeder-ukraine-gazprom-vladimir-putin-olaf-scholz-b2007898.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gerhard-schr...</a></p>"},{"id":"3ccd182e5943a046","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by delroth in \"Chrome's next weapon in the War on Ad Blockers: Slower extension updates\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:02:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:02:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1372.0577392578125,"y":3673.928140640259,"wires":[["f9b1f67c51b74599"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497191\n<hr>\n<p>You're just making stuff up at this point with no evidence or source.

Instead of saying \"Baby Peter is adult Peter\" (BP = AP) we can say \"Baby Peter will become adult Peter\" (BP < AP) or \"Adult Peter was Baby Peter\" (AP > BP). Unlike =, < and > are not equivalence relations. They are transitive, but they are neither reflexive nor symmetric. This way branching persons (forks or fusions) do not lead to paradoxes. If X branches into Y and Z, it is perfectly possible that X < Y, X < Z, and Y ≠ Z. The person that is about to enter the duplicator (X) <i>becomes</i>, one moment later, both the person that comes out on the left (Y) and the person that comes out on the right (Z). That doesn't mean that Y and Z are the same person, they just both <i>have been</i> X a moment ago.<p>This means that when we go to bed in the evening, there is a different person that comes out of the bed in the morning. But that's not so counterintuitive, since the evening person still <i>became</i> the morning person.<p>This weaker relation of \"becoming\" (rather than the stronger relation of \"being identical to\") can also serve as the notion of \"survival\". The evening person \"survived as\" the morning person.<p>Unfortunately Parfit didn't discuss this solution.</p>"},{"id":"fa938fee18fec80c","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by radicalbyte in \"Tinnitus linked to undetected auditory nerve damage\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:23:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:23:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1614.4690542455683,"y":3103.4691157665766,"wires":[["d43bd9b16945e5c6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497304\n<hr>\n<p>Same here!

I say \"approximately\" but I'm pretty sure the percentage of people <i>not</i> doing this is a rounding error we can ignore. Anyway, all the major IDE's, so far as I know, can import a Maven or Gradle project and work with it. So if you setup your project to use Maven or Gradle, you can share it around and anybody using any IDE (or no IDE) can work with it. Now there will still be (usually anyway) some IDE specific files that get created when you import the project into Netbeans, Eclipse, whatever. But those you can just mention in .gitignore and choose not to distribute with your project.<p>Not sure how all the various IDE's handle working with things like Make or Cmake for environments building with those tools, but I expect a similar pattern probably holds to a large extent.

The only reason for using a class here is more as a general principle if you want it to be easier to pass your \"usercreator\" around as a value, but you can of course wrap it in a lambda if needed or use `#method`. Alternatively you can just make it a lambda from the start. If your main objection to the class is the ease of breaking encapsulation, lambda's are quite nice for tighter encapsulation of state in Ruby.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>     lambda do\n       state = 0\n       ->() { state += 1 }\n     end.call\n</code></pre>\n(Note the `.call` at the end - we don't want the outer lambda; that is just used for creating the variables that will hold the state - we want the inner lambda)<p>So let's say that for some stupid reason your user creator object needs to keep a count of users, you could \"seal\" that state into a lambda with the above technique, and make it really hard (I'm not sure if <i>impossible</i>) to break encapsulation. E.g. instance_eval or trying obtain the binding doesn't work, because they both will get you the state of the Proc object containing the closure, not the local variables accessible within it.</p>"},{"id":"9aae5e97337d4425","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by CR007 in \"Ask HN: Who is hiring?

No- you can have a heat mover which is capable to only move heat from hot to cold like a water cooler in a PC.</p>"},{"id":"55b5b1b69dc479c6","type":"subflow:4e50a033c1e93dbd","z":"f4a4b607bfdd1399","name":"New comment by randomdata in \"Cocoa harvested by kids as young as 5 in Ghana: CBS News investigation\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:47:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 09:47:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5091.9998779296875,"y":3371.604736328125,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497402\n<hr>\n<p>Is there something to suggest that school is a horrible experience?
