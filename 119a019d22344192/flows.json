LSP servers are complicated beasts coming with a lot of specific dependencies. It is simply impossible to ship all available language servers together with Emacs. Even VSCode does not do it. For popular languages it downloads them automatically for you. But this is exactly what \"lsp-mode\" (the alternative to \"eglot.el\") does already [1].<p>My personal prediction, however, is this: Thanks to the advent of the static parser framework \"treesitter\" we will see language servers becoming obsolete in the long run. Treesitter enables an editor to load a parser backend as a plugin and on top of that provides a powerful query API to semantically analyse your code. This should be sufficient to implement all of what an external language server does already but inside the editor's process.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/</a></p>"},{"id":"cef54b9bd02ac95","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by pjmlp in \"Google Chrome pushes browser history-based ad targeting\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1568,"y":4100,"wires":[["3aeba14905f47a96"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402904\n<hr>\n<p>Best alternative is not using any at all.<p>Web, Web widgets (available on most OS for 30 years), or native.</p>"},{"id":"22c524d3afab7a62","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by abwizz in \"The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4178,"y":4260,"wires":[["c4bc3fdc63735136"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402903\n<hr>\n<p>probably a bubble thing as most produce of the hn crowd does indeed not need any trucking</p>"},{"id":"258e194c98a20a69","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by philo23 in \"Fighting API bots with Cloudflare's invisible turnstile\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4068,"y":2296,"wires":[["4094a766f67efb4c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402902\n<hr>\n<p>Interesting that both the client side API and server side API for Cloudflare's turnstile seem to match Google's reCAPTCHA nearly exactly, which works in pretty much the same way with the exception that you can't configure it to _never_ show a visual captcha (in rare cases the v2 Invisible reCAPTCHA will still show the \"select all the X from the images below\" dialog)<p>Even down to the API endpoint and JS API names.<p><pre><code>  https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify\n  https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify\n\n  grecaptcha.render({ callback: function (token) { ... } });\n  turnstile.render({ callback: function (token) { ... } });\n</code></pre>\nAs soon as I saw the examples I recognised the names, I guess it's designed to be a drop in replacement?<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify</a>\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible</a></p>"},{"id":"29e5d898abdb37ca","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by pixelpanic360 in \"NATS report into air traffic control incident details root cause and solution\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2584,"y":2768,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402901\n<hr>\n<p>Why these baseless conspiracy stands?</p>"},{"id":"a66764e82f3d883","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by jfk13 in \"Google Chrome pushes browser history-based ad targeting\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:18:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1568,"y":4140,"wires":[["3aeba14905f47a96"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402900\n<hr>\n<p>I believe Firefox blocks them by default.

This is Jeane and Samuel and we’re building RecipeUI. RecipeUI is an open source Postman alternative that uses TypeScript to statically type and autocomplete requests.<p>We built this because current API tools don’t deal with the fact that some APIs are just painful to work with. For us, it’s usually error after error as we try to figure out how to properly form the first request.<p>We recorded a demo to show you how TypeScript helps us autocomplete a request correctly.\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/O_Mly_p-g5s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/O_Mly_p-g5s</a><p>How does our platform improve the developer experience? The analogy is similar to using a statically typed language vs dynamically typed. Most API tools are dynamically typed. You’re guessing the params and relying on the request to magically work at runtime, only for you to go back to stack overflow or the docs when it doesn’t.<p>We take the approach of defining parameters and the schema first. When you add a new parameter, you need to mention upfront if it’s required and what type it is (integer, string, boolean). While this can be painful in the beginning, it will save you and anyone you share this with the hassle of understanding how this API works.<p>Our app is cross-platform on web and desktop. Our desktop app is <20mb and built on top of Rust with Tauri, NextJS, and Supabase. We open source our code because we want to be transparent about how API requests and secrets are handled (all local IndexDB).<p>I built the first version of this at Robinhood when my colleagues were sharing bash scripts and internal APIs on slack to test things. I wanted to make it easier for anyone to use an API quickly and made use of our OpenAPI specs to generate a nice autocomplete API tool. Soon after, the Options team, then the Crypto team, and then the whole eng org at Robinhood adopted this tool!<p>Try it out at recipeui.com!

Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.<p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.<p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].<p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.<p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.<p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.<p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   \nI’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well.

The tl;dr is: It's complicated. What you say, may be true in some cases, but not in others. One does not always scale better than the other.<p>For example, ANN indexing with an index like HNSW scales pretty much logarithmically. A bit oversimplified, but roughly we see search times double with every 10x of the search space. In addition, calculations like euclidean distance and dot product (and therefore cosine sim) can be parallelized very well at a hardware level, e.g. AVX2/AVX512/neon and similar SIMD techniques.<p>With BM25, this isn't quite as simple. We have algorithms such as WAND and Block-Max-WAND, which help eliminate _scoring_ elements that cannot reach a top-k spot. However, the distribution of terms plays a big role here. As a rule of thumb, the rarer a word is the fewer documents require scoring. Let's say you have 1B documents, and a 2-term query, but each term matches only 100k documents. If you AND-combine those queries, you will have at most 100k matches, if you OR-combine them, you will have at most 200k. The fact that there were 1B documents indexed played no role. But now think of two terms that each match 500M objects. Even with the aforementioned algorithms – which rely on the relative impact of each term – there is a risk we would now have to score every single document in the database. This is, again, over-simplified, but my point is the following:<p>ANN latency is fairly predictable. BM25 latency depends a lot on the input query. Our monitoring shows that in production cases, when running a hybrid search, sometimes the vector query is the bottleneck, sometimes the BM25 query is.<p>> Hybrid search can be used to first filter a smaller number of candidates and then rerank them using vector search<p>My post is already getting quite long, but want to quickly comment on this two-step approach. For Weaviate, that's not the case. BM25 and vector searches happen independently, then the scores are aggregated to combine a single result set.<p>Yes, you could also use BM25 as a filter set first, then re-rank the results with embeddings, however you wouold lose the BM25 scores. If you want to use keywords just as filters, you can do that much, much cheaper than through BM25 scoring. In Weaviate matching keywords to create a filter set, would only require AND-ing or OR-ing a few roaring bitmaps which is orders of magnitides more efficient than BM25 scoring.<p>Disclaimer: associated with Weaviate.</p>"},{"id":"c3cb020b0ceb7a3c","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by daef in \"Microsoft to stop forcing Windows 11 users into Edge in EU countries\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:29:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:29:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2832,"y":4314,"wires":[["d2f20e76b6a4df9c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402955\n<hr>\n<p>maybe enough hn users could get their companies stop using windows (but i guess the sysadmins are on slashdot iirc)</p>"},{"id":"f8f5d2231419333a","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by gumballindie in \"Microsoft to stop forcing Windows 11 users into Edge in EU countries\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:29:00 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:29:00 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2832,"y":4354,"wires":[["d2f20e76b6a4df9c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402954\n<hr>\n<p>Now if hn users start making casual apps work on linux by contributing to wine and proton that may change.</p>"},{"id":"aacb3c38a591f6f9","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by wildrhythms in \"The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:28:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:28:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4178,"y":4452,"wires":[["c4bc3fdc63735136"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37402953\n<hr>\n<p>>Note that refusing to answer is fine<p>I was required to put a \"desired salary\" in an application form.

Sorry, I was typing on a phone and it turned into a real word salad/jargon mess :)<p>I was replying to someone asking how I got my \"classic\" 1990s-era Amiga screenshots to look so fancy. The built in Amiga AGA chipset is pretty limited by today's standards and gets slower/uses more memory the higher you push the resolution and colour depth. Most classic Amigas run on low-res limited colour screens - the default is 640x256 in 4 colours. On an 68030-accelerated Amiga I could just about push it to 800x600 in 256 colours, but it was very sluggish.<p>I now have a Vampire Accelerator card which adds a much faster CPU core, along with an embedded graphics chipset, HDMI output, networking, SD card interface and other nice things. The Vampire \"graphics card\" is driven through the AmigaOS's support for \"ReTargetable Graphics\" (RTG).<p>My vintage 1992 A1200 is running a hacked together OS, using a base of \"CoffinOS\" which is a distribution of AmigaOS favoured by Vampire accelerator users. It consists of a classic AmigaOS 3.x installation along with all the Vampire-specific drivers, utilities, games and other things all ready to go out of the box. Because it ships copyrighted AmigaOS binaries and other things that may not be 100% legal to redistribute (and the Amiga scene in general is a litigious mess), I won't link to it but it's easy enough to find[1].<p>On top of this, I have installed various components from Hyperion's AmigaOS 3.2, so it's a sort of mash-up of two different distributions of AmigaOS. To get my fancy looking icons, I used the \"Faenza\" icon set in PNG format.<p>Hope that clears it up a bit!<p>[1] Side note - Apollo Accelerators (the makers of the Vampire) are working on ApolloOS which is a legally clean distribution of the open-source AmigaOS clone, AROS. This is what you'll get (and is officially supported) if you buy a new Vampire card or stand-alone Vampire V4 system although CoffinOS is still being developed and distributed by a mystery team.</p>"},{"id":"22ca799f7cb8237d","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by johngladtj in \"The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:39:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:39:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4178,"y":4516,"wires":[["c4bc3fdc63735136"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403014\n<hr>\n<p>That's always an excuse to not pay market rates.<p>If you really need doctors NOW, bump up the rates as high as they will go.

More generally EOB won't be the lexicographically last symbol if there are length codes used only once in given block. But it's already possible that the Huffman tree was not optimal anyway, so such cases are safe to ignore as we can rely on the fallback.<p>> The overhead of looking for deflate blocks can actually be made arbitrarily small by simply increasing the chunk size because you only have to check the first ~64 kiB of the chunk for a valid start position.<p>But it still means that you need to probe all 2^16 positions.

We’re Brad and Scott from Nullstone (<a href=\"https://nullstone.io\">https://nullstone.io</a>), a developer platform to deploy and manage cloud apps and infrastructure. Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?sid=91afe471-e5ac-462d-829a-1f762f3ab2fd\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.loom.com/share/924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?...</a>.<p>Running your app on a major cloud provider makes a lot of things easier, but it’s tedious to configure IAM, security groups, networking, secrets, autoscaling, health checks, zero-downtime deployments, and more. It is also difficult and time-consuming to release and synchronize app and infra changes across many apps and environments.<p>Nullstone provides an intuitive developer experience to deploy any app—be it an API, web app, static site, or one-off job—to AWS or GCP. We provide a simple, consistent experience for automatically deploying to any platform (e.g., Fargate, Kubernetes, Lambda, etc.). We provision and configure infrastructure depending on your use case (e.g., networks, clusters, datastores, load balancers, third-party logging providers, and much more). We offer many features that are hard to build in-house: automatic secrets management, GitOps, and preview environments.<p>Everything runs in your own cloud accounts. You own your data and we cannot access it. Secrets are stored in your secrets manager. We support all app types (e.g. APIs, web apps, frontends, jobs, etc.) and platforms (e.g. containers, serverless, s3 sites, VMs, etc.).<p>Instead of being a black box, our infrastructure modules are open source and you can hot-swap each module for your own Terraform. You can automate deploys and preview environments via GitHub integrations, CI/CD integrations, CLI, or API. All infra/deploy logs are easily accessible through the UI, CLI, and API.<p>We scan our modules against compliance frameworks to provide a foundation of compliance for your infrastructure. If there are vendors or platforms we don’t support, we provide a quick framework and open hooks to add support.<p>Nullstone is intended for software teams that don’t want to build an in-house platform. Our customers span many industries and have used us to reduce cloud costs by up to 90%, provide developer self-service, fully automate deployments, migrate to containers, and more.<p>Previously, we built an internal developer platform at McKinsey (serving 300 workloads across 1000 engineers) to solve a major pain point: engineers were building apps in weeks only to wait months to provision and secure infrastructure (and once provisioned, making changes to the apps was a frustrating back-and-forth process). Later I joined a cybersecurity company and as our team grew, I saw the same challenges: we were spending more time configuring infrastructure than building the product.<p>We decided to build Nullstone because no existing solution fit our needs. Some of the products we found were all-in-one solutions, meaning we had to sacrifice the tooling we liked and use infrastructure with insufficient security, compliance, and reliability controls. Other products, built for enterprises, provide a poor developer experience in exchange for costly licenses and significant internal resources to operate.<p>To provide a fully customizable experience that is easy-to-use for developers, we had to solve a few problems. (1) We had to present infrastructure as code configuration in a way that isn’t overwhelming, but allows for flexibility to handle various architectures. (2) We had to insulate developers from infrastructure-as-code errors that would confuse them, while maintaining a level of transparency that devs demand. (3) We had to build tooling around module development because infrastructure takes 10x longer than app code to get feedback on whether it’s working properly.<p>Nullstone is free for individual use. After that, we charge $100/user/month. A user is anybody committing code that is deployed through Nullstone.<p>Our docs are at <a href=\"https://docs.nullstone.io/\">https://docs.nullstone.io/</a> and our public roadmap is at <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1\">https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1</a>.<p>We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, and we look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391272\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391272</a></p>\n<p>Points: 93</p>\n<p># Comments: 59</p>"},{"id":"660c338ae8bbb849","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by archo in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:45:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:45:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2976,"y":888,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403052\n<hr>\n<p>Yes, I did Laugh Out Loud at this response;<p><i>As my knowledge is limited to the information available up to September 2021,<p>I don’t have access to specific unpublished works or any new material that may have emerged after that time.<p>Therefore, if such a passage exists in Proust’s writings, it might be in a part of his work that I’m not aware of.</i></p>"},{"id":"795693c7c234e135","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by speedgoose in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:45:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 09:45:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2104,"y":944,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403051\n<hr>\n<p>Non-profit doesn't mean bad salaries.

Apparently the \"backup system\" was conceived for this purpose. According to the report (page 17) the responsible subsystem apparently suffered from a \"<i>critical exception from recurring for any flight plan that triggers the conditions that led to the incident</i>\", which let both the primary and backup system fail, and was now apparently fixed. So obviously the system was not supposed to fail on receiving wrong or suspicious flight plan data, and it was apparently pure luck that no such data arrived for five years. To claim that the subsystem (consisting of the primary and backup system) \"safely failed\" indicates significant gaps in safety management (either faulty safety analyses, faulty specifications, or faulty configuration or software).

As the article says, it can work well and be minimally invasive for users (they need to run JS but that's a much lower bar than solving complicated CAPTCHAs).<p>There are several services like Turnstile. I'm an advisor to Ocule [1] which is a similar thing, except it's a standalone service you can use regardless of your serving setup rather than being integrated into a monolithic CDN. It's a smaller company too so you can get the red carpet treatment from them, and they aren't so aggressive about blocking VPNs and privacy modes because their anti-bot JS challenges are strong enough to not need it. They're ex-reverse engineers so know a lot about what works and what doesn't. Their tech may be worth looking at if you're concerned about over-blocking.<p>The mention of Turnstile using proof of work/space is a bit puzzling/disappointing. That stuff doesn't work so well. There are much better ways to create invisible JS challenges. The core idea is to verify you're in the intended execution environment, and then obfuscate and randomize so effectively that the adversaries give up trying to emulate your code and just run it, which can (a) lead to detection and (b) is very slow and resource intensive for them even if they aren't detected. Proof of work/space doesn't prove much about the real execution environment.<p>BTW, the author asks what proof of space is. It's where you allocate a huge amount of RAM and then ensure the allocation was actually real by filling it with stuff and doing computations on it. The goal is to try and restrict per-machine parallelism by preventing many threads running in parallel, something end users won't do. Obviously it's also a brute force technique that can break cheaper devices.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://ocule.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ocule.io/</a></p>"},{"id":"a4fce441bb9fc907","type":"subflow:61b610c661cd2e45","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by jpc0 in \"Ask HN: I’m an FCC Commissioner proposing regulation of IoT security updates\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:02:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 10:02:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1108,"y":3556,"wires":[["8a74983d7ef44120"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37403169\n<hr>\n<p>A competent technician with access to a workshop can make even 80 year old vehicles work.
