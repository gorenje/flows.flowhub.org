Shahar and Tal from Keep here.<p>A few months ago, we introduced here at HN (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34806482\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34806482</a>) Keep as an “open source alerting CLI” and got some interesting feedback - mainly around UI, automation, and supporting more tools. We were VERY early back then, and we understood that although the current DX around creating alerts is not great, it's not that critical and developers don’t need another tool just for that.<p>But we did find something else.<p>While talking to developers and devops, we found that a lot of companies use many tools that generate alerts - from Cloudwatch, Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog to tools such as Zabbix or Nagios. We definitely agree consolidation in the observability space is a real thing, but while talking to those companies we feel that there are still real use cases for having more than one tool (and for example, according to Grafana’s 2023 observability survey, 52% of the companies uses more than 6 observability tools <a href=\"https://grafana.com/observability-survey-2023/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://grafana.com/observability-survey-2023/</a>).<p>So we that in mind, we rebuilt Keep with a simple mindset: (1) Integrate with every tool that triggers alerts - it can be either pushing alerts to Keep via webhooks or routing policies or Keep to pull alerts via the tools API. (2) Create a simple abstraction layer to run workflows on top of these alerts. (3) Maintain a great developer experience - open source, API-first, workflows as code and generally having a developer mindset while building Keep.<p>During the time we rebuilt Keep, Datadog released their workflow automation tool (<a href=\"https://docs.datadoghq.com/service_management/workflows/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.datadoghq.com/service_management/workflows/</a>) which led us to the understanding that's exactly what we solve - but for everyone who uses tools other than Datadog.<p>A short demo of Keep with a simple use case: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMRCZM8ZYg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMRCZM8ZYg</a><p>You can try it yourself by signing into <a href=\"https://platform.keephq.dev\">https://platform.keephq.dev</a><p>Like always - we invite you to try Keep and we are eager to hear any feedback.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37381268\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37381268</a></p>\n<p>Points: 148</p>\n<p># Comments: 49</p>"},{"id":"fe743fbaf23e8110","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by didntcheck in \"When tech says ‘no’\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:15:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:15:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":null,"y":null,"wires":[["3cd062d579ab7e88"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391192\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"5849495568cfb069","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by codemusings in \"Leaving GitHub\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:15:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:15:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":904.4101562500001,"y":1286.2026834487915,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391191\n<hr>\n<p>Sure, but are basic git operations the same as Github features (PRs, Code Review, Actions, etc.)?

In a high-dimensional cube randomly sampled vectors are mostly near the edge of the cube, not at all what you expect based on two or three dimensions. There's other hitches, too.<p>When using vector search, you're making two leaps - that your document can really be summarized in a vector (keeping its important distinguishing semantic features), and that it's possible to retrieve similar documents using high-dimensional vectors. Both of these are lossy and have all sorts of caveats.<p>What would be great is if these new vector DB companies show examples where the top-ten \"search engine results page\" based on semantic embedding / vector search is clearly better than a conventionally-tuned, keyword-based system like ElasticSearch.

We’re Brad and Scott from Nullstone (<a href=\"https://nullstone.io\">https://nullstone.io</a>), a developer platform to deploy and manage cloud apps and infrastructure. Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?sid=91afe471-e5ac-462d-829a-1f762f3ab2fd\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.loom.com/share/924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?...</a>.<p>Running your app on a major cloud provider makes a lot of things easier, but it’s tedious to configure IAM, security groups, networking, secrets, autoscaling, health checks, zero-downtime deployments, and more. It is also difficult and time-consuming to release and synchronize app and infra changes across many apps and environments.<p>Nullstone provides an intuitive developer experience to deploy any app—be it an API, web app, static site, or one-off job—to AWS or GCP. We provide a simple, consistent experience for automatically deploying to any platform (e.g., Fargate, Kubernetes, Lambda, etc.). We provision and configure infrastructure depending on your use case (e.g., networks, clusters, datastores, load balancers, third-party logging providers, and much more). We offer many features that are hard to build in-house: automatic secrets management, GitOps, and preview environments.<p>Everything runs in your own cloud accounts. You own your data and we cannot access it. Secrets are stored in your secrets manager. We support all app types (e.g. APIs, web apps, frontends, jobs, etc.) and platforms (e.g. containers, serverless, s3 sites, VMs, etc.).<p>Instead of being a black box, our infrastructure modules are open source and you can hot-swap each module for your own Terraform. You can automate deploys and preview environments via GitHub integrations, CI/CD integrations, CLI, or API. All infra/deploy logs are easily accessible through the UI, CLI, and API.<p>We scan our modules against compliance frameworks to provide a foundation of compliance for your infrastructure. If there are vendors or platforms we don’t support, we provide a quick framework and open hooks to add support.<p>Nullstone is intended for software teams that don’t want to build an in-house platform. Our customers span many industries and have used us to reduce cloud costs by up to 90%, provide developer self-service, fully automate deployments, migrate to containers, and more.<p>Previously, we built an internal developer platform at McKinsey (serving 300 workloads across 1000 engineers) to solve a major pain point: engineers were building apps in weeks only to wait months to provision and secure infrastructure (and once provisioned, making changes to the apps was a frustrating back-and-forth process). Later I joined a cybersecurity company and as our team grew, I saw the same challenges: we were spending more time configuring infrastructure than building the product.<p>We decided to build Nullstone because no existing solution fit our needs. Some of the products we found were all-in-one solutions, meaning we had to sacrifice the tooling we liked and use infrastructure with insufficient security, compliance, and reliability controls. Other products, built for enterprises, provide a poor developer experience in exchange for costly licenses and significant internal resources to operate.<p>To provide a fully customizable experience that is easy-to-use for developers, we had to solve a few problems. (1) We had to present infrastructure as code configuration in a way that isn’t overwhelming, but allows for flexibility to handle various architectures. (2) We had to insulate developers from infrastructure-as-code errors that would confuse them, while maintaining a level of transparency that devs demand. (3) We had to build tooling around module development because infrastructure takes 10x longer than app code to get feedback on whether it’s working properly.<p>Nullstone is free for individual use. After that, we charge $100/user/month. A user is anybody committing code that is deployed through Nullstone.<p>Our docs are at <a href=\"https://docs.nullstone.io/\">https://docs.nullstone.io/</a> and our public roadmap is at <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1\">https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1</a>.<p>We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, and we look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391272\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391272</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"e6fac74a7721ae5c","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Back End Developer Roadmap","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:20:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:20:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":null,"y":null,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.alexhyett.com/backend-developer-roadmap/\">https://www.alexhyett.com/backend-developer-roadmap/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391267\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391267</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"be746a7f17732062","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"IBM Cloud to 'uplift' prices by up to 29 percent","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:20:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:20:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3886.062685378005,"y":1838.2151536607055,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/05/ibm_cloud_price_uplift/\">https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/05/ibm_cloud_price_uplift/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391264\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391264</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"81c8ffe8e2db3fd4","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Amazon and Google plan to let their voice assistants team up on one device","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:20:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:20:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2673.17171791046,"y":2711.2797157222235,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2023/08/31/amazon-google-smart-speakers\">https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2023/08/31/amazon-google-smart-speakers</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391256\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391256</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"71b26422b8b55921","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Robust Usage Reporting with Stripe","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:19:54 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:19:54 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2499.7638954638805,"y":2272.046710996543,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>I recently looked into how to build out robust usage reporting with Stripe.\nThis comes basically from the set of challenges around:<p>- Workaround Stripe API Rate Limits\n- Handle billing cycles and minimize usage drift into the next billing cycle\n- Deliver usage exactly once to avoid under and over-billing\n- Stripe requires to report usage on Subscription Items<p>You can read the full blog post here: \nhttps://openmeter.io/blog/how-to-report-usage-to-stripe<p>Curious about what people do to build our usage reporting.\nDo you use message queues?

I wanted to advertise Equinox -- my now-surprisingly-popular ( :D ) JAX library for numerical models. These days that often means \"neural networks\", but I like to emphasise that this also includes ODEs/SDEs/linear solves, etc.<p>For those already using JAX, then Equinox is interesting because (a) it ships with a NN library, and (b) this is built around the idea that \"everything is a pytree\", which makes things easy to reason about and easy to compose. Furthermore (c) Equinox offers advanced tools like true runtime errors, out-of-place pytree surgery, and checkpointed while loops, and AFAIK in the JAX ecosystem these are unique to Equinox.<p>For those most familiar with PyTorch: for many use cases (sciML in particular), JAX has a much stronger compiler, more advanced autodiff, etc. And whilst JAX itself is akin to the `torch` namespace, libraries like Equinox are then akin to the `torch.nn` namespace.<p>Because of its speed and features, right now JAX+Equinox is my favourite approach to numerical computing. So I'd love for some more people to try it.

But, it's a trade off still.</p>"},{"id":"f14152682684fc51","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by chrisjj in \"France prepares to ban vegetarian products from using meaty language\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:51:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:51:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":425,"y":4134.5,"wires":[["f5eac78391a904a2","44369ad848b981de"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391621\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"c014bddf0b13f346","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by mhb in \"Open source screw counting machine\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:51:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:51:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1937.770894158625,"y":1857.8962298076065,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391620\n<hr>\n<p>I guess this is just a fun project, but obvious question, and maybe answered in the TFV or TFA, but weighing them?</p>"},{"id":"ba16e82eb0ea0f5d","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by 0xDEFACED in \"Researchers have found that micro-spikes etched into titanium rupture microbes\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:51:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:51:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2025.1231081945916,"y":2728.14340797753,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391619\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for adding a new word to my vocabulary!

Overall, PCs were just much more accommodating to developers than the Apple products until Steve Jobs came back and switched everything over to UNIX-based operating system.</p>"},{"id":"f6beedcff219d6a6","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by smoldesu in \"Anonymous uploaded a text file with a Nyancat on UNESCO website\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1791.2749211755536,"y":3609.2306235868446,"wires":[["251f69dbbe36a106"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391679\n<hr>\n<p>> felt the urge to upload the past contents protesting Google's harsh inactivity policy<p>???</p>"},{"id":"bfc456f2cb7991c2","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by kossamums in \"What is a flop?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:55:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:55:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2919.037865573714,"y":2481.726152464894,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391676\n<hr>\n<p>A flop is the right foot and flip is the left.</p>"},{"id":"aebb872ca1492def","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by L0in in \"Ask HN: How to learn work ethics and discipline as an adult?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:55:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:55:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1526.9297668744616,"y":3899.4367472727263,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391674\n<hr>\n<p>> Be in a situation if you mess up, you'll get severe negative reactions from others.<p>I agree with seeking a position of responsibility, and be accountable, but i disagree with the above point.

that's the thing.<p>i had kids late. but i wasn't really any more ready to have kids in my 30s than i was in my 20s. and on the other hand i don't feel any different as far as life stage goes in my 40s than in my 20s. yes, i am and feel more mature, but my interests haven't changed and i am just as willing to explore the world now as i was then.<p>but now i have the financial means to do that, which i didn't have then.<p>and i am from a country where parenting is financially supported by the government, so there is absolutely no need to have saved money to be a parent.<p>in countries where this isn't the case the situation is perhaps a bit different, but then, lacking financial resources doesn't stop people from having kids, and even those will be better off in their 40s and still be able to explore their interests more than they were in their 20s.<p>the only thing that gets in the way is the expectation from others, to have a house, to have a career, to stop being impulsive when you are older, lack of support from their own parents, etc.<p>i see it happening in china. people get married and have children much earlier. most have very supportive grandparents (because the grandparents want kids) and when these couples are in their 40s and 50s they are still full of energy and are able to enjoy their life.</p>"},{"id":"fca52aab3a77a483","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by tantalor in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:01:55

The most general form that I know of the winning strategy is: minimize your expected time to reach $X, for arbitrarily high values of X, eg $1M or $1B (ie, in the limit to infinity). Following this strategy will eventually beat any other strategy, 100% of the time.<p>For many people, the expected time to reach say $10 million is infinite: they simply cannot produce more than they consume, and in 10 years (or 100)  they expect to be no better off materially than they are today. Any amount they try to save will eventually be used for some emergency (eg car breaks down, or health, or eviction/rent going up, or ... ).<p>Even assuming that the expected value of a lottery ticket is deeply negative, it is then Kelly-rational to buy lottery tickets, or more generally take a chance on any possible way of getting out of this equilibrium.<p>Of course I am handwaving certain reasonable objections, and the argument can fail if indeed there is a chance of leaving the equilibrium otherwise, and the price of a lottery ticket is too high, but ultimately I believe the argument does apply to a not-insignifocant percentage of buyers of lottery tickets.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391727\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391727</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"e1d86dc2926cdeed","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Google Groups Spam?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:59:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:59:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3230,"y":3880,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>I've begun receiving google groups spam, and I can't report or unsubscribe because I can't sign in - no way to determine (apparently) what redirect alias they may be using.<p>Anyone else encountered this?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391716\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391716</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"f1f7c979f49d8057","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Embeddable Code Playgrounds/Sandbox Environments","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:59:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:59:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3651.053459203803,"y":4139.332591273113,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://codapi.org/\">https://codapi.org/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391710\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391710</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"263c9564336170bf","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"An Update on Facebook News in Europe","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:59:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:59:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2475.735867554023,"y":4345.237760042874,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/an-update-on-facebook-news-in-europe/\">https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/an-update-on-facebook-news-in-europe/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391709\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391709</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"ff7e65f2cb8e66ac","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:58:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:58:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2493.173233850099,"y":3891.6679140683364,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391704\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391704</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"4b6c2fd3be3cf134","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"BGP Flaw Can Be Exploited for Prolonged Internet Outages","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3967.518616506258,"y":2960.101189015437,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/bgp-flaw-can-be-exploited-for-prolonged-internet-outages/\">https://www.securityweek.com/bgp-flaw-can-be-exploited-for-prolonged-internet-outages/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391690\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391690</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"15a5dbd22c0d484c","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Ask HN: Is there a “spend more money” problem in political discourse?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4220,"y":4280,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>I don't know if this has always been the way or if it's just something I've been noticing more recently, but almost every political conversation I get into anymore seems to result in the other person arguing that the government needs to spend more money. And this is often layered with the accusation that their unwillingness to spend more money is proof they don't care.<p>I wouldn't deny there is always going to be some truth in this. At the end of the day money does fix most problems and any problem that is a high enough priority will likely have more resources allocated to it.<p>However, it seems the vast majority of people struggle with solutions more complex than \"spend more money\". Even the media will discuss problems in the simple terms of how much money one group of politicians want to spend another.<p>I find myself often having to explain there are limited resources and for the government spend more money per capita on anything they either need to increase the tax burden, borrow more and offset the problem to future generations, or find some way to increase productivity. The only one of these that is a solution long-term is raising productivity since it's not possible to sustainably keep spending more in real terms via tax increases and borrowing alone.<p>A few examples of conversations I've had recently:<p>Kids falling behind in school? Spend more money. Bad health care? Spend more money. Energy bills too high? Spend more money.<p>What upsets me is that it's difficult for me to even argue that higher taxes, more borrowing and more government spending can't be the solution to all of our problems. I often get accused of not caring about the issues or not understanding people's suffering, but this is exactly why I get so worked up about this and why I want us to find sustainable solutions.<p>One major problem we have here in the UK is that people will not accept any other solution to our healthcare problems other than spend more money on the NHS. It's really difficult to explain to people that when real GDP per capita has not meaningfully increased in the last 15 years and when we have an aging population and a growing population we literally cannot afford the same quality of healthcare unless it comes at a significant expense to spending elsewhere. This isn't my opinion, this is just the economic reality of the longer-term realities of the situation we're in. The amount of government spends per capita far more a product of the country's GDP per capita than of relative tax rates and government deficits.<p>Do you agree this is a problem, and if so is there anything we can do to make political discourse more pragmatic about the complexity of the problems we face? I get the sense people were more pragmatic about the limits of government spending in the past, and that this idea that the government should be able to fix all of our problems is a recent trend. It also seems to be playing into dissatisfaction people have with politics more generally and I don't think this is healthy for democracy.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391678\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391678</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"a148f3176826ec48","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Okta customers targeted in social engineering scam","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:56:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3551.364874821076,"y":4091.46596760787,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.scmagazine.com/news/okta-customers-targeted-in-social-engineering-scam\">https://www.scmagazine.com/news/okta-customers-targeted-in-social-engineering-scam</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391677\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391677</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"6db2325f9f0716cc","type":"subflow:8a657d89551f17b2","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Entertain Your Cats Automatically with LazerPaw","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:55:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:55:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2751.9646040006646,"y":3419.4270226170224,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2023/09/05/entertain-your-cats-automatically-with-lazerpaw/\">https://hackaday.com/2023/09/05/entertain-your-cats-automatically-with-lazerpaw/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391675\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391675</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"44369ad848b981de","type":"subflow:1065d1d7d32e19e9","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"France prepares to ban vegetarian products from using meaty language","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:46:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:46:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1080,"y":4500,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/05/france-prepares-to-ban-vegetarian-products-from-using-meaty-language\">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/05/france-prepares-to-ban-vegetarian-products-from-using-meaty-language</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391573\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391573</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>"},{"id":"ce471dd0af1d987c","type":"subflow:1065d1d7d32e19e9","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Android 14 blocks all modification of system certificates, even as root","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:42:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:42:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4130,"y":4520,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-breaks-system-certificate-installation/\">https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-breaks-system-certificate-installation/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391521\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391521</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"1137305d6f0086e8","type":"subflow:1065d1d7d32e19e9","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Australian MPs to lobby US to drop Julian Assange prosecution","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:28:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:28:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":950,"y":3060,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/05/australian-mps-to-lobby-us-to-drop-julian-assange-prosecution-or-risk-very-dangerous-precedent-for-russia-and-china\">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/05/australian-mps-to-lobby-us-to-drop-julian-assange-prosecution-or-risk-very-dangerous-precedent-for-russia-and-china</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391365\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391365</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"81e42a2d0a2e39b1","type":"subflow:1065d1d7d32e19e9","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"Launch HN: Nullstone (YC W22) – An easier way to deploy and manage cloud apps","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:21:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:21:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4530,"y":1420,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Hi HN!

It is also difficult and time-consuming to release and synchronize app and infra changes across many apps and environments.<p>Nullstone provides an intuitive developer experience to deploy any app—be it an API, web app, static site, or one-off job—to AWS or GCP. We provide a simple, consistent experience for automatically deploying to any platform (e.g., Fargate, Kubernetes, Lambda, etc.). We provision and configure infrastructure depending on your use case (e.g., networks, clusters, datastores, load balancers, third-party logging providers, and much more). We offer many features that are hard to build in-house: automatic secrets management, GitOps, and preview environments.<p>Everything runs in your own cloud accounts. You own your data and we cannot access it. Secrets are stored in your secrets manager. We support all app types (e.g. APIs, web apps, frontends, jobs, etc.) and platforms (e.g. containers, serverless, s3 sites, VMs, etc.).<p>Instead of being a black box, our infrastructure modules are open source and you can hot-swap each module for your own Terraform. You can automate deploys and preview environments via GitHub integrations, CI/CD integrations, CLI, or API. All infra/deploy logs are easily accessible through the UI, CLI, and API.<p>We scan our modules against compliance frameworks to provide a foundation of compliance for your infrastructure. If there are vendors or platforms we don’t support, we provide a quick framework and open hooks to add support.<p>Nullstone is intended for software teams that don’t want to build an in-house platform. Our customers span many industries and have used us to reduce cloud costs by up to 90%, provide developer self-service, fully automate deployments, migrate to containers, and more.<p>Previously, we built an internal developer platform at McKinsey (serving 300 workloads across 1000 engineers) to solve a major pain point: engineers were building apps in weeks only to wait months to provision and secure infrastructure (and once provisioned, making changes to the apps was a frustrating back-and-forth process). Later I joined a cybersecurity company and as our team grew, I saw the same challenges: we were spending more time configuring infrastructure than building the product.<p>We decided to build Nullstone because no existing solution fit our needs. Some of the products we found were all-in-one solutions, meaning we had to sacrifice the tooling we liked and use infrastructure with insufficient security, compliance, and reliability controls. Other products, built for enterprises, provide a poor developer experience in exchange for costly licenses and significant internal resources to operate.<p>To provide a fully customizable experience that is easy-to-use for developers, we had to solve a few problems. (1) We had to present infrastructure as code configuration in a way that isn’t overwhelming, but allows for flexibility to handle various architectures. (2) We had to insulate developers from infrastructure-as-code errors that would confuse them, while maintaining a level of transparency that devs demand. (3) We had to build tooling around module development because infrastructure takes 10x longer than app code to get feedback on whether it’s working properly.<p>Nullstone is free for individual use. After that, we charge $100/user/month. A user is anybody committing code that is deployed through Nullstone.<p>Our docs are at <a href=\"https://docs.nullstone.io/\">https://docs.nullstone.io/</a> and our public roadmap is at <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1\">https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1</a>.<p>We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, and we look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391272\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391272</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"41596027d789cbfb","type":"debug","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"debug 29","active":true,"tosidebar":false,"console":false,"tostatus":true,"complete":"payload","targetType":"msg","statusVal":"","statusType":"counter","x":1896,"y":813,"wires":[]},{"id":"57b13f538c002186","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by drewcoo in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:07:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:07:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1874,"y":1330,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391827\n<hr>\n<p>> I know it's more commonplace in women.<p>There are plenty of women who are perfectly happy without kids, too.<p>And that doesn't mean those men and women don't like kids or don't have kids in their lives.

I believe Michael Stonebraker's conjecture continues to be that a \"one size fits all\" database engine is essentially unachievable, and therefore you can't expect a single database system to be competitive across both domains simultaneously. However some databases (SQL Server springs to mind) are apparently pretty good at running multiple engines in parallel.<p>With the v2 XTDB engine design we are sacrificing some of our graph capabilities in the short term (WCOJ and self-join optimisations) for what we feel are more pressing advantages of the columnar model (low-cost retention of history and vectorized processing). We are also aiming to retain reasonable OLTP performance as well, in a similar vein to SingleStore etc., since the target audience is still application developers rather than data analysts.<p>If you are looking for a way of using Datalog on existing columnar storage engines today, you should definitely look at <a href=\"https://logica.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://logica.dev/</a><p>Also, this Stonebraker talk on \"Big Data is (at least) Four Different Problems\" is pretty good: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRcecxdGxvQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRcecxdGxvQ</a></p>"},{"id":"7bd38c4809fdb538","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by diogenes4 in \"Android 14 blocks all modification of system certificates, even as root\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:20:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:20:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3505,"y":4498.5,"wires":[["ce471dd0af1d987c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37392014\n<hr>\n<p>Hah, I have exactly the opposite reaction as you: I think Android is a complete mess in terms of usability.<p>The big differentiator, though, is your social network.

If you have a something mounted to /apex/whatever and each app has a separate mount namespace, then mounting over /apex/whatever in your namespace wouldn't change anything in any other mount namespace.<p>The latter 'separate mount namespace' here is the surprising bit. Previously, you could open a shell, mount things into the filesystem (or just modify it directly) and apps would happily read files from those mounts.<p>Now, for these cacert files, that's not the case, and additionally with the new approach direct modification is impossible.<p>Before this change, I wasn't even aware that Android apps were using their own mount namespaces! There's very little documentation on exactly how that works and I'm not sure if there's been a case where its been clearly visible until now.</p>"},{"id":"c0e99ede8f9bc6b9","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by davethedevguy in \"The World’s First U2 Spy Plane Photo Shoot at the Edge of Space\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:19:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 14:19:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":445,"y":3747,"wires":[["282f2b38489bad85"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391994\n<hr>\n<p>I can't speak for the US, but in my country that was sometimes the case, but not always.<p>I was an engineer and had 'non-camo' uniform, and only wore cammo in the field or on exercise.<p>People who's job was primarily 'in the field' though (e.g. the Army) didn't have that, and would wear cammo as their uniform 90% of the time (the exception was formal dress uniform for parades etc.)</p>"},{"id":"10520ef8a2a327f1","type":"subflow:bf156d8394d6715b","z":"119a019d22344192","name":"New comment by archo in \"Tech workers flocked to Austin.
