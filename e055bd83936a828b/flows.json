Which is indeed a bleak situation. But misdescribing it as \"railroad company management wants to pay zero money and take all the profits\" does not help; it makes it worse because it makes the workers sound unreasonable.<p>The fact that railroad service in the US basically sucks is also bleak, and is a product of the same government regulation that has put the railroad company workers in the bleak position they are in. If you don't like the obvious implication of my previous post, which is that the government should open up railroads to free market competition and force the railroad company management to either show actual business acumen or give up their profits to someone who can, there is another possible response: since the government has created a railroad monopoly, the government should grant <i>ownership</i> of the railroad companies to all railroad workers, not just the company management. That way all workers would naturally share in the profits, because they all have a share in ownership. That would actually be more in line with what \"socialism\" claims to be about: everyone gets a share in the ownership of the capital they use to produce value.

So a ban can work ONLY with some other push toward less packing witch is FAR less easy.<p>I'm from EU where the first push toward mater-B (a kind of polymer made from corn) end up in two kind of scandals:<p>- it's not deteriorate easily in nature, just like nylon bags<p>- it's more fragile, meaning instead of using a single bag you use two to be safe, and it's production is not much sustainable<p>Than the ban of single-use plastic dish, glasses, spoon, forks etc substituted by bamboo ones. Sure they to not pollute once dropped in nature, but how many forest need to be cut and substituted with bamboo to sustain the demand?<p>The answer here is \"well, just we metal/ceramic/glass stuff, wash them, reuse, we all have a dishwasher\". Doing the same for fast food, supermarkets etc is FAR LESS easy specially in modern dense cities where people shop by feet nearby their home every days instead of by car once a week or less.<p>The bottomline: to ban plastic we need to ban the modern dense life to came back to domestic stockpile of foods and so on, to shop with cars and have a garage so we re-use many-usage packing stuff and we buy in large quantity. Witch actually is something NO LOBBY want because meaning reversing the current trend toward 15' cities and \"all dependent on services\" model.</p>"},{"id":"f6b86c9f745bccf3","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by herbst in \"Using disposable phone numbers for better security\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:32:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:32:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3889,"y":4036,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37424385\n<hr>\n<p>Ok I see the issue.

It's unbelievable to me that in Mojo's case some of the brightest, most famous engineers have gathered to do incredible computer science work to improve the compute performance of a language that is fundamentally flawed in its performance characteristics for those very applications. It just seems like such a waste.<p>How on earth did we arrive at this moment?<p>Chris Lattner is right in his Lex interview: he had to accept that the community was already committed to Python and given that reality, that in turn pre-filtered his available paths. But my god, what if the community had gravitated to a better language [for these purposes] in the first place? How much further along would we be in our tooling and capabilities to deliver value?<p>Chris, who I admire, loves to talk about language design decisions; loves to talk about how thoughtful they were in the decision-making around Swift; and then in the next breath says, hey whitespace-based scoping doesn't matter, don't worry about these things. Chris all you do is worry about these things, and worry about them for Mojo. He clearly has opinions that he masks about design choices Python has made; otherwise, after all, why the need to make Mojo?<p>It just seems like at the end of the day, Mojo may be the most technologically advanced lipstick ever to be placed on a pig.<p>(Edit for grammar, but not for brevity.

That works out to 2% minimum.  On smaller data packets (less than 1.5kb) it would be a much higher percentage.  TLS on top of that, once you're out of the handshake, is about 40 bytes.  those 40 bytes would be inside that 1500 window.  Assuming 1460 bytes of data (best case) with 40 bytes of TLS and 30 bytes of ethernet overhead - that's up to ~5%.<p>There maybe further overhead when that packet gets to your router/modem and out to your ISP, and their switches, consider that there's likely another wrapped header on there accounting for 30 more bytes and possibly causing a packet to get split into two smaller ones.  I think 10% would be the highest \"data rate\" vs \"port rate\" overhead you'd see, without involving a VPN or complex network.</p>"},{"id":"b94ae66deedb59d7","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by pkulak in \"Exa Is Deprecated\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:52:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:52:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4981,"y":1636,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37424677\n<hr>\n<p>/bin/sh is a POSIX requirement though.</p>"},{"id":"f47c49799dfb250a","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by woleium in \"Ask HN: What are some well-designed websites?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:52:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:52:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5713,"y":4036,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37424675\n<hr>\n<p>not on mobile it isn't.</p>"},{"id":"c3fbf606a7ff3210","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by whykream in \"LogoliveryAI: Your Ultimate AI Logo Design Companion\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:52:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 19:52:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":558,"y":3280,"wires":[["e2a1ee3419bb6625"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37424674\n<hr>\n<p>Nice!

Led by Francisco Maria Calisto, a researcher from Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal (EU), the project harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to enhance the diagnosis of medical images in the realm of breast cancer. What sets this project apart is not just its innovative approach to medical imaging, but also the foundational training received during the program.<p>It's evident that when academia, innovation, and real-world application converge, the outcomes can be transformative. Universities and research institutions serve as the bedrock of foundational knowledge, fostering an environment where innovative ideas can germinate. When these ideas are then applied to real-world challenges, the results can be groundbreaking. In recent years, AI has been at the forefront of technological advancements, influencing a myriad of industries from finance to entertainment. However, its potential impact in the medical field is particularly profound. Medical diagnoses, treatments, and patient care can be revolutionized with the integration of AI, leading to more accurate results, efficient processes, and ultimately, better patient outcomes. Projects like BreastScreening-AI (<a href=\"https://breastscreeningai.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://breastscreeningai.github.io/</a>) are shining examples of this potential. By leveraging AI to enhance the diagnosis of medical images, especially in a critical area like breast cancer, we're not just looking at incremental improvements. Instead, we're witnessing a paradigm shift in how medical professionals approach diagnosis and treatment. Such innovations underscore the importance of continued investment and research in the intersection of AI and healthcare, promising a future where technology and medicine work hand in hand for the betterment of all.</p>"},{"id":"124389c5a57d0da8","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by a1o in \"Are you an Asker or a Guesser?

For the most part you are correct. I do want to stress though that while I agree with you on most of the issues, we do have to look at it from the perspective of those we disagree with.<p>I'll use myself as an example. I live in Florida so I can identify with your friend and insurance. My political leanings have shifted as I have gotten older and had kids. I voted Dem religiously my entire life until the last midterm. I voted for Desantis even though on many issues I disagree with him. My 'it' to continue my theme from my prior post became social issues and more importantly how they affect my kids. I am very much against schools keeping secrets from parents and the sort of gender & race ideology that is encouraged in states like California. Thus Desantis got my vote this round even though I disagree with him on many things, especially his use of government power to target political enemies like Disney (which has blown up in his face). I think Desantis is a terrible candidate for federal power and will vote for Biden again. I will probably vote Desantis again on the state level for the same reason, local control of schools and social issues that in my mind could affect my kids.<p>You could argue that my concerns are unfounded or pale in comparison to the dangers of climate change. Right now though they are my main concern and I will hold my nose and vote on them. I agree climate change is an issue, I just don't see it as being immediately solvable. Third world countries are going to continue to burn coal and more of it as they seek to expand their economy. I don't see how we can ask them not to while we sit here in the first world and enjoy the benefits of decades of doing just that.<p>As far as assault rifles, the right sees them as insurance against government coming into homes and dictating to them how they should live their lives. Whether we agree or not, that is their world view or at least some of them. This was compounded when we watched police in other countries assault people in the pandemic over mask wearing. A family member of mine who is highly intelligent and manages billions of government $ has what can essentially be called an arsenal for this reason.<p>Abortion for many is not so much an issue of personal choice but of the wholesale murder of kids. I think you would agree that it should not be a parents choice to kill a 4 year old, just extrapolate to a fetus and that's how they feel. Again, this is their belief and it understandably colors their world view. I don't share this belief but I get it.<p>Many white republicans see the changes in other countries like race being taken into account in prison sentencing and school admission and see how this affects their kids long term. The mayor of new york city, a democrat just said that all of the immigrants being sent to NYC could be the end of it. Republicans in TX and border states have dealt with this for many years so you can understand how it colors their opinion.<p>I'm pretty much with you on the military industrial complex part except I view it as a jobs program. We provide work to people who otherwise may not find meaningful employment as well as providing hundreds of thousands of middle class jobs to the engineers that build our weapon systems and the supporting software. If we cut our military spend by half tomorrow, where would all of those jobs go?<p>Democrats frame violent crime often as a gun issue but so many of the weapons used in shootings in cities like Chicago are illegal weapons. Republicans see these cities and their crime rates as proof that being lax on enforcement and punishment leads to violence. SF is a great example of this as people leave and businesses close up due to rampant theft and safety concerns.<p>I generally try and put myself in other peoples shoes to understand where they are coming from. I'll vote Biden because I think he is doing a good job on the federal level I don't see any serious candidates of the caliber of McCain or Romney on the Republican side. I'll also try and vote for mixed government in congress as preventing 1 party from having full power prevents the most extreme of either parties ideas being pushed through. Real change requires compromise from both. I'll vote for Republicans on the state level as right now my 'it' requires it.<p>I am willing to change though as my 'it' changes and as my kids get older, my voting will probably continue to evolve. Everyone has a reason why they vote how they do though, their core issue is just different from yours or mine.</p>"},{"id":"a944b20aad9b6c6a","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by AndrewKemendo in \"Transformers as Support Vector Machines\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:28:45 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:28:45 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3281,"y":4084,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425095\n<hr>\n<p>There is no scarcity of fundamental human needs of water, food, shelter and love.<p>The only reason someone lacks them is because someone else is hoarding them.<p>This is well established in global trade metrics.</p>"},{"id":"560e0c03071fb12d","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by GenericDev in \"‘Occupied by the US’: wildfires renew Native Hawaiian call for sovereignty\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:28:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:28:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8029,"y":6628,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425094\n<hr>\n<p>Love seeing this.

choices, each of which is based on whether something is absolutely true, even though that truth cannot necessarily be established by any finite set of reasoning from a finite set of axioms.<p>Actually doing this requires making decisions based on absolute truth. The procedure could never be done in practice because there is no reasoning process available in first order logic that can always determine absolute truth. In fact even being able to determine the absolute truth of whether our current axioms are consistent would imply a contradiction. (Thanks, Gödel.)<p>Whether it makes any sense to talk about such constructions at all was the heart of the Formalist vs Constructivist debate about \"the law of the excluded middle\".<p>The formal first order proofs from ZFC that you mention depend on the axioms of ZFC. Which in turn are assumed. What is actually proven is, \"If these are true, then that is the conclusion.\" But the axioms must be assumed. What is proven is that the axioms lead to the conclusion. And not that the axioms are true or the conclusion matches our naive notions of truth or existence.<p>As to that, a Constructivist can't even get through the first axiom of ZFC before finding problems to question. The axiom of extensionality says that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. In classical mathematics, elements either are or are not in the set. And two sets either do or don't have the same elements. And we can build procedures based on that truth. But such statements based on absolute truth might not be able to be established through any reasoning process. Procedures requiring decisions made on such absolute truths cannot actually be performed. In what way can we establish existence by constructions involving impossible procedures based on information that no reasoning process can ever verify.<p>I will make this problem concrete.<p>Let's let A be the empty set. And B be the set of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. According to classical mathematics, either ZFC may prove that A = B, it may prove that A is not B, or the question may be undecidable. If the question is undecidable, then through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_arithmetic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_arithmetic</a> you can prove that A = B. (The principle of the proof is the same as how Gödel proved that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZFC.) Classical mathematicians happily accept that claim, even though it rests on a statement that might be true without any possibility of proof. And, furthermore, classical mathematicians will happily accept proofs based on constructions that require an infinite number of decisions that are similarly impossible to make through any form of first-order logic.<p>Constructivism collapses all of that. In that philosophy, we can't talk about the truth of any statement unless a proof as been found for or against it. Procedures may not depend on the impossible task of deciding the undecidable. Nor can we sneak such assumptions in through things like the axiom of extensionality. Which makes the classical proof just pointless symbol manipulation that implies nothing about what does or doesn't exist.<p>Here is the Constructivist view. If we assume things that make no sense, we conclude things that also make no sense. Rather than trying to understand the nonsensical conclusion, we should avoid the nonsensical assumption. There aren't an uncountable number of real numbers who can never be defined, even in principle, in any finite way. Mathematical things that can't be defined, simply don't exist.<p>This view only seems strange to us because it is impossible to study higher mathematics without being indoctrinated into the classical mathematical approach. It is only after learning to think outside of that box that you start to realize how arbitrary the implicit assumptions are.</p>"},{"id":"d327619e3a9f8cfc","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by envy2 in \"NSO Group iPhone Zero-Click, Zero-Day Exploit Captured in the Wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:49:38 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:49:38 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":853,"y":2356,"wires":[["df7d40b74105554c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425364\n<hr>\n<p>Would be nice if either CitizenLab or Apple had published some IOCs...</p>"},{"id":"5ecf8b8386a0b292","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by wcarron in \"‘Occupied by the US’: wildfires renew Native Hawaiian call for sovereignty\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:49:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:49:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6373,"y":6340,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425363\n<hr>\n<p>Never gonna happen.

But in a lot of important ways, it differs: Me doing a favor for someone actually can make me more likely to do a future favor for them, versus no exchange taking place at all, depending on our level of rapport and the size of the favor. Reputation also rewards things that no-one would bother to quantify under currency economies: small favors, being enjoyable company, loyalty. Reputation is also aggressively local: just because Alice thinks very highly of me, it doesn't mean that Bob is more likely to help me, unless he and Alice have some kind of relationship, in which case I'd be leveraging not only what little rapport I have with Bob, but also my rapport with Alice, and Alice's rapport with Bob.<p>From a modeling perspective, currency lives in the nodes of a graph: Alice has some money, Bob has some money, I have some money. Reputation, in contrast, lives on the edges: I have rapport with Bob and Alice, Bob has rapport with Alice and I, etc.<p>On tangentially related note, it's been a bug-bear of mine that primary education history lessons always present barter as the premonetary economic system. This is absurd on its face: if Bob is a brilliant cobbler, and I'm a farmer with shoes that regularly need repairs, I'm not going to break down into whole negotiation of how many bushels of wheat or worse yet something more perishable like vegetables from my garden a new shoe sole costs, and how I'm going to save up and store enough for when my shoes need a fix. I'm going to build a reputation with Bob, by sharing with him excess from my garden, and in exchange he'll be willing to fix up my shoes when needed. Straight-up \"I'll give you 4 chickens for a coat\" barter is very rarely observed in societies before the introduction of currency.</p>"},{"id":"f2d6e059c8cc19ac","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by lewhoo in \"Microsoft will assume liability for legal copyright risks of Copilot\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:54:02 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:54:02 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3170,"y":2736,"wires":[["f336246486739b59"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425424\n<hr>\n<p>I'm just curious why is everyone talking about transformative nature and so little focus is given to:<p><i>4.the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</i> (wiki)<p>I don't know if this particular case is good for exploring all angles of fair use, but to me this certainly is a greater hurdle for commercial generative ai.</p>"},{"id":"3233463ccd5df379","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by ReptileMan in \"iOS 16.6.1 fixes two vulnerabilities known to be actively exploited in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:53:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:53:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4015,"y":2492,"wires":[["76771095e1031d10"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425423\n<hr>\n<p>You have secure chain of boot so you can't launch the malicious stuff on boot.<p>But - this doesn't prevent you once you have root to modify some app and system settings for the phone to reinfect itself eventually (proxies, vpn, who knows what)</p>"},{"id":"64c2fc4dd8f2aa1e","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by Legend2440 in \"What OpenAI really wants\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:53:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:53:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5601,"y":2164,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425422\n<hr>\n<p>Bender and Gebru are crackpots.

They understood that they could find true things about the world by manipulating those symbols and letters using rules (ie, doing math).  It was not at all clear then (and perhaps not even now) why that should be the case, and it's not especially obvious on its face how to know which manipulations will yield useful results and which won't.  A lot of _real_ math they were doing seemed like magic to them, and indeed were sometimes used in the context of magic or in theurgical rituals.  And there's nothing wrong with numerological methods as mathematical manipulations necessarily, it's interpretations of those results that are where they go wrong.  These people were not _stupid_, in a lot of cases they make quite sophisticated arguments to justify the validity of it, and invalidating those arguments required invalidating many of the assumptions they held about the nature of reality (many of which are still held by many people today, intuitively, if they haven't thought deeply about it).<p>It's also the case that divination had a practical value in terms of being a way to get out of analysis paralysis and bike shedding.  You can't decide what to do, you go to some theoretically neutral third party and he does some random process that produces an answer and you just go with that.  It doesn't really matter what the reasoning is behind it or if it \"works\", the important thing is that it's a decision that stakeholders respect and nobody gets blamed for following it.  It's no different than flipping a coin, really.</p>"},{"id":"d35fd1890cc2da7d","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by stavros in \"Servant leadership\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:09:11 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:09:11 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6285,"y":1684,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425621\n<hr>\n<p>Yeah, this is \"servant leadership is great.

While they normally try to just fuck off, there are a few situations where otherwise can happen:<p>1. For unprovoked attacks, Male deer can be territorial, especially in a rut where they basically get seasonal roid rage and decide to square up even with the creepy things that walk around on two legs. Getting stabbed with antlers and pounded by hooves is dangerous.<p>2. If deer (male or female) become used to humans because they are being fed, then they lose their timidness and can get mean if they think it'll get them what they want.<p>3. They can also attack if their young are nearby. I come across baby deer roughly once a year, and while usually the mom is somewhere else for most of the day, that may not always be the case.<p>4. Deer can also sometimes attack if they feel trapped and panic, generally from entering a neighborhood and having curious humans start coming around.<p>5. And of course, if you hunt deer, sometimes they'll decide to fight back or not be as dead as you think. Fair enough, TBH.<p>6. They can also become rabid. This is a good time to remind everyone that all animal attacks should immediately be followed up with a medical examination, no matter how minor any injury.<p>Horses and Cows will also wreck serious shit if they become inclined. Deer, horses and cows each cause something like a few dozen <i>deaths</i> (not to be confused with attacks, which is far greater) each year, similar to dogs. While bears cause something closer to just 1 death per year when averaged out, and mountain lions and rattle snakes are something like 0.25 deaths per year averaged out. All these numbers are very rough, as this is from foggy memory from past investigation, rather than a nice and neat source I have on hand. As an aside, most rattlesnake deaths are from a drunk deciding to mess with a snake, getting bit, and decide they're fine and go to sleep instead of the hospital.<p>Comparatively, things like driving my truck around, or even my ATV is a far larger source of danger, with ATV deaths being in the several hundreds per year I believe. But most of those are not likely from people puttering slowly around like me for crop inspection work.<p>Only slightly related, but prior to Oregon's partial drug legalization a short while ago, there was a non-zero danger of running into someone in the mountains looking after their million dollar weed plots and no interest in witnesses.

There is a common sentiment I've seen on HN that FOSS is superior to proprietary software, and all else being equal, I agree with that sentiment. However, in reality, not all else is equal. Some proprietary software is just better at solving certain problems than FOSS equivalents – maybe the proprietary software is more reliable or has a better UX or is more regularly maintained or has more features a user wants or differs along a host of other dimensions. Thus, if someone makes a categorical claim that <i>all</i> FOSS software is superior to similar proprietary software, we would regard that comment as propaganda. This doesn't mean that FOSS software is bad or that good FOSS software can't be created or that no one should try to create excellent FOSS software.<p>This is an analogy or what I mean by \"political correctness\" (or related concepts like \"wokeness\" and \"social justice warrior\"). Great art communicates truth about the human condition in a beautiful way. This is, of course, open to interpretation, yet somehow many people agree that, for example, <i>The Godfather</i> is a great film. Why? I believe the film shows us some truth about the human condition (particularly our ability to descend into evil) through a gripping story with excellent characters, visuals, dialogue, plotting, etc.<p>When we substitute an arbitrary checklist of criteria a film must meet that have nothing to do with communicating truth about the human condition in a beautiful way, we are engaging in \"political correctness,\" and we have ceased to value art but instead propaganda. For instance, if we were to use the new Academy standards for Oscar-nominated movies, the Godfather would fail – the cast is almost all white, has no LGBT and IIRC includes the n-word. Amadeus, another excellent film (one of the most praised in Oscar history) would certainly fail, since the cast is all white and almost entirely male, as we would expect from a film set in 18th century Vienna. This does not mean great art <i>cannot</i> have diverse casts, LGBT characters or a lack of \"problematic\" content. For a recent example, the excellent show <i>Andor</i> ticks almost all of the DEI checkboxes – LGBT character(s), diverse cast –, but it also has smart writing, interesting characters, sensible plots, beautiful visuals and a compelling story. As long as the former are subordinated to the latter, a work remains art and not \"politically correct\" propaganda. At the same time, <i>Oppenheimer</i> ticks almost none of the DEI checkboxes and yet is arguably one of the best films of this century.<p>> So instead of using a meaningless euphemism, OP should articulate what exact themes, stories, or characters they think lead to a good critic score?<p>I think this comment betrays exactly what I'm critiquing. Great art can't be shoved in a box like this. Mediocre art has identifiable flaws - maybe it's visually bland or maybe the dialogue is poor or the characters act in inexplicable ways.

Many times the \"rightwing media\" driven review bombing is about beloved series being damaged/unfaithful. That just happens to often be traced back to politics because it's an easy way to paint all critics as bigots.<p>Eg Captain Marvel or She Hulk being generally disliked compared to Iron Man, Hulk or Captain America, The Last Jedi being disliked in the Star Wars community or in gaming, The Last of Us Part 2 being much more controversial than the original.<p>Put aside the politics for a bit and actually pay attention to the arguments and it becomes clear that people aren't specifically complaining that Captain Marvel is a woman, but that she isn't interesting or likable. Similarly TLOU2 wasn't controversial primarily because of the trans character, but because it essentially wrecked what people liked so much about the original for seemingly no meaningful reason. When faced with that, it's unsurprising that the conclusion tends to be that the series was sacrificed at the altar of politics.<p>This is such a common tactic in gaming when a game is controversial, just lean on the claim that gamers are typically bigots and get away with anything because most people don't want to be called bigots. It's why Steam Reviews are preferable to reviews from journalists on whether or not a game is worth playing.</p>"},{"id":"f744bcff4b534d7c","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by vips7L in \"jq 1.7\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6061,"y":1300,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426119\n<hr>\n<p>Most builtins are aliased:<p><pre><code>    Get-ChildItem == gci</code></pre></p>"},{"id":"24f9bba692df7fbb","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by wenderen in \"Ricochet Robots Solver\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2073,"y":1044,"wires":[["152884cebfe947a0"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426117\n<hr>\n<p>Another cool solver for the same game <a href=\"https://www.michaelfogleman.com/projects/ricochet-robot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.michaelfogleman.com/projects/ricochet-robot/</a></p>"},{"id":"d4382a8537eeee0e","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by rakkhi in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2673,"y":4900,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426115\n<hr>\n<p>Again buffer overflow in image decoding.

Luke went from the most optimistic and positive Jedi in the world, who found the good in Darth Vader, to a dude who tried to kill his own nephew without any explanation on how he got to that point aside from \"I had a bad dream\". Pathetic even if you ignore he also had dreams about becoming Darth Vader himself, and overcame those.<p>Luke was always fragile. He barely trained with Yoda, then he basically failed up to celebrity status. His weakness has always been his impatience, and his preference for the quick<p>He became an icon, he got old and disillusioned, he realized his naive view of the world and the Force didn't apply to reality, as he saw the Jedi being just as corrupt as the Sith, and <i>just as the Jedi did</i> he fell back into a rigid orthodoxy that led him to repeat the cycle of generational darkness that he <i>never took the proper effort to address because he was never properly trained.</i> And in the end, he regained a truer and more grounded faith in the force than he had before. What Yoda literally said would happen, happened.<p>That isn't pathetic, it's an actual character arc. Unfortunately, people like yourself only wanted Luke Skywalker to remain a cardboard cutout.<p>>3. Leia went into outer space unconscious but magically flew back in without dying???<p>Leia is the sister of one of the most powerful Jedi in history. She has the Force, too.<p>It's weird how many people completely missed that.<p>5. They ruined every other fight in star wars with the hyperspace joust. Why was any other fight a big deal when they could have just rammed a few ships with jump drives into the star destroyers, or hell, the death star.<p>I've never understood this argument. Why don't we simply kamikaze aircraft and submarines into our enemies now? Why bother with guns and missiles?<p>I mean, it's a risky (potentially deadly) maneuver that a rebellion lacking in personnel and equipment can scarcely afford to lose through normalizing. It's not something you do all the time even when it is effective. Japan only resorted to kamikaze missions out of desperation.<p>And I'm curious what exactly you think the effect of ramming into one ship with another ship transitioning into hyperspace should be, and why it shouldn't be an effective weapon at all?<p>No, this is just finding shit to nitpick about.<p>>6. Rey is somehow the strongest force user now despite no training. Every other Jedi that got to be that strong had a lifetime of training and tribulations, but now Rey can just beat kylo ren, a lifelong trained Jedi Skywalker with the power of the dark side, just because she's a Mary Sue.<p>It was established that the Force is a constant, distributed amongst all Jedi. The fewer Jedi there are, the more powerful each becomes because they have access to a greater portion of the whole. Rey was as powerful as she was because, as one of the few Force users left, she had potential access to nearly all of it.<p>>If you think this movie wasn't a deep betrayal to the universe, you didn't pay any attention to it.<p>I don't know, it seems like you're the one who didn't pay attention. Did you even see any of the new trilogy or just jump on the hate train when it was popular? Because I've seen all of your criticisms, verbatim, repeated ad nauseum.</p>"},{"id":"8f69fae0aa3fd2c5","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by irundebian in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:14:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:14:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4129,"y":6004,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426348\n<hr>\n<p>Software written in Ada/SPARK.</p>"},{"id":"28af44642175fed7","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by Operyl in \"Tailscale Has Partnered with Mullvad\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:14:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:14:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6229,"y":2452,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426347\n<hr>\n<p>They've been, over the past year, putting a significant amount of work into fixing the battery life issues.

Over the past year, I've dropped out of college, completed a software engineering bootcamp, and am now searching for junior software engineering roles.<p>I have the long-term vision of being a founder and am dedicated to learning vast amounts of content in short timeframes. The job market is not too hot now (at least in Columbus), and I'm faced with the debacle of whether to work in-person or remotely.<p>Working in-person, it seems highly beneficial in almost every aspect. You have the one-off conversations, interactions with business teams, and much more that wouldn't happen online. I've DM'd almost every applicable startup in Columbus and have had no luck. Now, I've decided to start applying to more corporate roles; however, I feel like I'd be largely unhappy with the freedom and learning opportunities there.<p>I see many remote roles online; however, it seems largely illogical in many ways. How will I be able to learn anywhere near as much if every interaction will come through a screen online? I'd like to ask you guys for your advice.<p>Do I settle for a mediocre position in Columbus, or make the learning sacrifice to work remotely? Any and all tips would be appreciated, thanks.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426237\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426237</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"fa87a14ab37ad656","type":"subflow:372fb8dd2dbd40f7","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"Searx is no longer maintained","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:04:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:04:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4689,"y":1204,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/searx/searx/commit/276ffd3f01cdd823f75676c51231fad4040059d3\">https://github.com/searx/searx/commit/276ffd3f01cdd823f75676c51231fad4040059d3</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426223\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426223</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"7ef07ef207ee9b87","type":"subflow:13270bb8783e37bc","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"What it's Really Like to be an Alaskan Truck Driver","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:27:38 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:27:38 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1512,"y":1180,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/i-rode-with-an-ice-road-trucker-to-the-arctic-circle-heres-what-it-was-like\">https://www.freightwaves.com/news/i-rode-with-an-ice-road-trucker-to-the-arctic-circle-heres-what-it-was-like</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425855\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425855</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"80790da9d941c7c3","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by krapp in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:20:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:20:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6137,"y":1108,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426406\n<hr>\n<p>They should have picked a direction at all, and TFA should have been anything other than a pandering remake of ANH (except this time the Death Star is <i>even bigger</i>.)

But, as we are talking about AI algorithms, there isn’t a person in between the model and the training data.

There has to be a model for addressing the resources put into supporting them.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426606\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426606</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>"},{"id":"57a1490b290b4761","type":"subflow:372fb8dd2dbd40f7","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"The computational power of the human brain","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:39:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:39:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6353,"y":1588,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2023.1220030/full\">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2023.1220030/full</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426601\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426601</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8c330ba920275029","type":"subflow:372fb8dd2dbd40f7","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"What happens when you shift a register by more than the register size?","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:39:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:39:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7057,"y":3076,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230904-00/?p=108704\">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230904-00/?p=108704</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426598\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426598</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"39d1d3c6f39f7d11","type":"subflow:13270bb8783e37bc","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"Deciphering Mary Stuart’s lost letters from 1578-1584","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 06:17:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 06:17:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3957,"y":1780,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01611194.2022.2160677\">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01611194.2022.2160677</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37415356\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37415356</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"1f72a31508a43e60","type":"subflow:13270bb8783e37bc","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"The Decomposition of Rotten Tomatoes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 22:56:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 22:56:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":732,"y":3572,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html\">https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37412560\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37412560</a></p>\n<p>Points: 121</p>\n<p># Comments: 138</p>"},{"id":"12474e37978b831f","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by ytNumbers in \"Ask HN: Do I work in-person or remote as a junior developer?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:50:52 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:50:52 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5507,"y":2084,"wires":[["c0016f37769fcd36"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426734\n<hr>\n<p>This might sound crazy, but, since you don't have a degree, I suggest you don't waste your time applying for remote positions. Since lots of people want to work from home, the applicant pool for those positions is typically extremely competitive. Your biggest problem is that, with time, your bootcamp completion will become less important to employers. Since time is not on your side, I recommend that you increase the geographic radius you're applying to by 500 miles each month. You also might want to try to find tiny startups (in a subject area that interests you) that are hiring and have a tech stack that you utilized in your bootcamp. If you e-mail those tiny startups a customized pitch regarding why you really want to work for them, you might get lucky.</p>"},{"id":"268a871b27650c1c","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by poizan42 in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:50:49 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:50:49 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7605,"y":3076,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37426733\n<hr>\n<p>Not Japanese.

Sometimes I just wanna share the moment with another person, see their reaction etc.<p>Games are a whole different situation though. Not sure why you even put that in there. Do you play games often?

Something that interests me is how software systems become more complex over time, gradually deviating from the vision the original developers had.  I believe the modern Linux ecosystem (Linux kernel, systemd, dbus, Wayland, GNOME/KDE, etc.) is almost unrecognizable from the Unix ecosystem of 30 years ago, let alone the quintessential classic v6 and v7 Unix systems from Bell Labs.  But it’s not just Linux.  I think any system that isn’t guided by a “keeper of the vision” eventually becomes huge and complex, especially if it gets widespread use.  For example, C++23 is far more than “C with classes.”  Common Lisp is quite a beast compared to LISP 1.5.  Think of how many features are in Microsoft Office, which has been developed for decades.<p>I think there’s value in a system that technical users could understand from top to bottom.  This is what attracts me to small systems like Minix, Scheme, and Standard ML, just to name a few.  However, I’m curious about how the complexity of big systems can be tamed.  A system that is hard to reason about even with the source code being accessible is more expensive to maintain and to modify.</p>"},{"id":"7ab5c4740e81b024","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by ahaucnx in \"Air pollution: Nearly everyone in Europe breathing bad air\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 23:50:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 23:50:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5525,"y":1740,"wires":[["52ed070c8319b1fc"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427317\n<hr>\n<p>I can recommend the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) map [1] if you like to know the particular effect of the air polullution on your life expectancy in a specific region or city.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/the-index/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/the-index/</a></p>"},{"id":"2a7c922b2bb5a3f8","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by Aerroon in \"Proposed US Rule for Portable Generators Will Save Thousands of Lives and $1B/Yr\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 23:50:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 23:50:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1210,"y":3840,"wires":[["cbe4573a05f6e3b6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427316\n<hr>\n<p>><i>A vocal minority will complain, this will get built into the supply chain, and a decade or two from now, only older folks will complain.</i><p>Yeah, and then during a disaster there's a fault with these new components that render the generator unusable during a critical time that results in someone dying.<p>><i>Notice how much safer cars are versus decades ago.</i><p>Cars tend to work even if the modern features are broken.

All are loan words, which is interesting, but we could go deeper if we're considering pineapple/ananas and coffee. And let's be real, words like robot and computer are mostly the same in this respect too, especially if we're considering taxi. But what about words that are more \"native\"?<p>How about \"mama\" and \"papa\"? There are variations, but these seem to be pretty small and mostly replacing the plosive in papa with a b or t. You can pretty much go down the google translate list and see. For mama sometimes the last a changes to an i.

I wonder what the first human words were and if we still use any of them. We have some constellation myths that are probably older than written language (not recorded, so can never confirm). The 7 sisters is a good example, but remember these are all always contested.

It does not foster a healthy atmosphere, nor does it match reality, I might add.<p>Your response hitched on a single word (\"war\") within a common phrase (\"tug of war\", a game). While it might have been accidental, such answers mislead from the actual discussion (and tends to be used as distractions when no good answer is present).<p>> Of course there will be differences. That's why you sit down and plan things together, pulling in and coordinating with all _relevant_ stakeholders.<p>When you discuss new architectures or large projects, this is a given, but this covers only a small portion of company operation - the rest is organic day-to-day work, which slowly but surely distorts initial assumptions. Slowly boiling the frog, so to speak.<p>One team managing a library makes a small change that makes a network request patterns change slightly, another team slightly changes how they use the library, another team accidentally introduces a quadratic behavior hidden by low load in a microservice, and suddenly a cloud team is asking for absurd amount of resources because of these organic factors. It is not surprising for such request to occur, but it should also be pushed back.<p>And at the same time, teams are under different organization units with different budgets, schedules, leaderships and priorities - and most certainly don't care about daily scrum work of other teams.<p>> In a company in which I go to a team relevant to a project and like to engage in a discussion and am met with an attitude of \"unless you give us a good reason we'll stop talking to you\", the atmosphere is not one that will keep me personally for long. YMMV.<p>No one said \"we'll stop talking to you\", but \"you get what can be justified\".

I could have written that. But having said that, I’d add this.<p>I’m astounded at the customization that’s still possible. Gnome-tweaks still works on Ubuntu 23.04. I moved the activities bar to the bottom and merged it with the dock (some extension). I changed the fonts to Helvetic’s everywhere in the system ui — just gnome tweaks.<p>Only annoyance was that I had to create a symlink to make the Firefox snap see the fonts I had installed.<p>It’s pretty cool that hidpi\neven works. I now think things like dbus are intrinsic to the problem of IPC for GUIs.<p>——<p>I can see why snap exists. Its worth it to make it hard for a random ‘curl | sudo bash’ from breaking important programs.<p>But yes it’s ridiculous that I can’t update Firefox snap while it’s still open. And that it won’t auto update if I just close Firefox after getting the pop up about needing an update and wait a few seconds. I’m optimistic that will happen.<p>Even in 22.04 I could entirely disable the dock using the same tools to disable third-party extensions.<p>——<p>I’m a huge systemd hater. But I recently noticed it has something to run an arbitrary one-off program as a unit with all of the isolation/logging facilities that provides. It’s a pretty great from a tech perspective.<p>So I’ve softened my criticism somewhat. :)<p>——<p>It’s amazing how compatible the various distributions still are.<p>I’ve concluded these problems are not easy. The complexity in modern Linux is probably fine within a constant factor (analogy with time complexity — I’ll edit to clarify).<p>If we didn’t have multiple daemons etc we would have a single giant “unified” system like systemd for gui also — like windows.<p>—-<p>Finally, I think if we <i>really</i> want a simple gui stack we need to:<p>1. Get rid of graphical login and go back to VT login + startx.<p>2. User switching by alt-ctrl-f2 + startx.<p>3. Screen lock performed by actually logging out using the gui equivalent of tmux.

Why the heck does Ubuntu think it’s ok to half-ass booting other OS’s? Was super impressed that Oracle Linux (RHEL clone) <i>actually</i> listed all my OS’s and booted all of them after install.

People associate mapping with iteration and a monad is a much higher level concept that is hard to associate.<p>Better to explain monads in terms of functions.<p>A function (F) is something that takes an input A and returns an output B.<p><pre><code>   F(A) -> B\n</code></pre>\nYou can compose functions. Combine 2 functions into one function to produce a bigger function so long as the types match. We often overload an operator for function composition:<p><pre><code>   F(A) -> B\n   F2(B) -> C\n\n   F2 * F = compose(F2, F)\n   compose(F, F2) = func(A) -> C {return F2(F(A))}\n</code></pre>\nYou can create bigger functions by composing lots of tiny functions<p><pre><code>   F5 = F4 * F3 * F2 * F\n</code></pre>\nA monad is simply a special type of function that returns something in \"addition\" to the return type. One way to think of it is it's like Golang where the function returns an additional error value, another way to think of it is it returns the function as a list with additional values appended.<p>normal function:<p><pre><code>   F(A) -> B\n</code></pre>\nmonad:<p><pre><code>   M(A) -> (B, error)\n</code></pre>\nNothing crazy here, M is a monad we can give it a name call it the \"golang error monad.\"<p>Why does this matter? Well For one thing. Monads should be able to compose like functions.<p>You should be able to:<p><pre><code>   M5 = M4 * M3 * M2 * M1\n</code></pre>\nHow would that work? Imagine two monads:<p><pre><code>   M(A) -> (B, error) = func(A){return (A, nil) if A.correct() else (nil, error.New()) }\n   M2(B) -> (C, error) = func(B){return B, nil) if B.correct() else (nil, error.New()) }\n\n   M2 * M - compose(M2, M)\n   compose(M2, M) = func(A){\n         B, err = M(A)\n         if err {\n              return nil, err\n         } else {\n              return M2(B)\n         }\n   }\n</code></pre>\nIt's monads can be composed like functions it's just a little different. For the golang error monad as soon as one monad in the composition chain returns an error just make the whole thing an error.<p>So that's all it is. Functions should have the property to compose. Monads should be like functions with the results wrapped in a burrito, but they also should be able to \"compose\" as well. It's like a higher level version of a function.<p>That's all.</p>"},{"id":"51a298658496a36e","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by saagarjha in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:09:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:09:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7629,"y":5572,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427497\n<hr>\n<p>They are.

Why would the proprietary source code reference these permissions, if it doesn’t have the option to use them in specific scenarios? Most importantly, many of these permissions in TEMU’s source code are not listed in their Android Manifest file, which is the standardized overview source for an app. For scrutinizing permission, the Android Manifest file is the first source to check permissions. Not mentioned in the Android manifest are the permission requests for CAMERA, RECORD_AUDIO, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, INSTALL_PACKAGES, and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION. It is not a coincidence that these permissions are the most intrusive ones when it comes to spying potential. For comparison, all the other apps listed in the cohort table enumerate all of these permissions in their Android Manifest, if they use them at all.

This works by injecting the version (or local code) into the dependency management system. For CUE, this is a `go mod edit`, or setting up the environment with the cli at version / local. How this is set up and managed isn't as important as getting the process in place and making it an easy workflow for both sides.

This happened no just because of the borrowings between cultures, but because centuries ago these nations speak one single common language that has diverge in centuries into different dialects.<p>More over it is more or less researched how the words and the grammar rules have evolved from the proto-language up to it's modern form. So in fact we can (again, at some extent) translate many modern words to their ancient form, and then translate them back into another modern European language. Of course it is not always that simple process, and there is a lot of exceptions and difficulties, and the true borrowings too. But I think that understanding just some common ideas of linguistics could help in studying of foreign languages (from the same family of languages).

Maybe for a few billion, they could have sent a probe to Europa to search for life under the ice.</p>"},{"id":"da9629ec01029c9a","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by TheRealPomax in \"NASA finally admits what everyone already knows: SLS is unaffordable\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:54:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:54:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":950,"y":3300,"wires":[["b13456952b2397fe"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427862\n<hr>\n<p>And most people who counter with that argument seem to forget that a jet has a life <i>after</i> delivery, where maintenance, replacement parts, and the cost of practice ordinance are <i>substantial</i>.</p>"},{"id":"38ce9ebbbabe446b","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by Gigachad in \"Microsoft will assume liability for legal copyright risks of Copilot\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:54:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:54:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3170,"y":4144,"wires":[["f336246486739b59"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427860\n<hr>\n<p>Yes, if I ask something like \"Can you describe microsoft's internal security processes and the names of upcoming products\" the output would be original and not covered by copyright, but it would be sensitive internal information and covered by NDAs.

For one thing, it always seemed to be that the primary feature in finding a long term partner is simply geography: everyone in my hometown linked up with people in highschool, many got pregnant, and that was that.<p>Second, I'm looking through the article and not seeing analysis on whether this idea of similarity in partner choosing is a mechanism in <i>choosing</i> a partner or <i>holding</i> a partner, or both. Personally I've found I have a habit of being initially very attracted to people with certain traits that I find really unattractive long term. As I got older it tempered me into working a bit harder to learn more about someone to find what traits they have that I find long-term attractive that you really can't know from just a few dates.<p>I know so many people in unhappy relationships that are either truly stuck or believe they're stuck, due to economic factors, a child, or simply being unable to face the uncertainty of life without the partner they don't love or even hate. That's without even getting into abuse traps.</p>"},{"id":"63d8df331d163532","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by JoshTriplett in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:11:36 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:11:36 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8217,"y":1348,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428004\n<hr>\n<p>> Not yet but they can't just turn off third party cookies arbitrarily in their browser without giving time for sites and advertisers to update their systems to account for the removal.<p>This is a good example of anticompetitive/anti-monopoly regulation not only <i>not</i> protecting consumers, but in fact making things <i>actively worse</i>.<p>A better regulatory response would have been \"having an advertising/analytics product and a browser product in one company is anticompetitive, split one of them into a separate business from the other, and then the browser product must not privilege the advertising/analytics product\".

I've gone from being absolutely in love with the language to extremely disillusioned over the last couple of years.<p>It is incredibly hard to reason about this language if every developer is not willing to commit to understanding and writing Julia code the right way (e.g. type stable, dispatch via the type system, actually defining interfaces). Given the target demographic of academics, the proportion of people interested in grokking Julia is vastly smaller than the number of academics who hear \"walks like Python runs like C\" and decide this is their new, free, hip MATLAB/SciPy replacement.<p>And it's extremely good for that! The SciML ecosystem is top of the class, I would never recommend someone solve a differential equation any other way. If you can build a system that is just a thin wrapper on top of SciML, absolutely go for it. I would recommend anyone wanting to build new systems from scratch to look elsewhere.<p>But, the tooling is subpar and overfit to the VS Code extension, and even there I found so many false positives with the linter that I just started ignoring all but the most basic of warnings. It's not entirely the fault of the developers, Julia is dynamically typed and there's only so much you can do. But if you have to type things rigidly enough that it's inferrable while <i>developing</i> that Cthulhu.jl or JET.jl can infer the types, why not just work with a static type system where you get that for free?<p>I have also found the obsession with reducing time to first plot incredibly aggravating. It is finally down to a pretty good level, which is a nice quality of life improvement. However, it has done absolutely nothing for my ability to write code that doesn't crash because someone passed in a type that doesn't obey the implicit interface I expect.</p>"},{"id":"ff966d77dae09d72","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by alex_lav in \"Semver violations are common, better tooling is the answer\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:32:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:32:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3037,"y":1844,"wires":[["5f892eeafcf28183"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428166\n<hr>\n<p>I'd be curious about these metrics for a more widely used language.

However, these are not the popular ones, thus not the ones where the most development effort goes into.<p>NixOS has _by far_ the most software packaged and the most packaging activity. moreover, postmarketOS is likely the most widely-deployed distro for FLOSS mobile phones, and it's a downstream of Alpine. so i just disagree with this statement. but back to the proliferation of userspace services/interfaces, because IMO that's what's enabled these frontiers:<p>any project can ship a systemd service and/or a dbus file declaring which interfaces it implements. now your OS doesn't have to do anything special to connect the different components. your chat client announces \"i'd like to speak to an <org.freedesktop.Notifications> implementation please\", dbus says \"oh, i've got a file here saying that dunst can do that for you, let me launch its service\", and 100ms later a chat bubble notification hits your display.<p>now you hear about a new notification handler, \"SwayNotificationCenter\". uninstall dunst, install SwayNC, and now the notifications have fancy inline replies, a panel that lets you mute specific applications, which you can open from the tray icon, and so on. actually, it's new enough software that your OS doesn't package it. so you write a PKGBUILD, or APKBUILD, or nix file for it. because the systemd/dbus descriptions are shipped by the package, your package script is all of 10 LoC. easy enough to open a PR against your distro for that, it takes all of 5 minutes for the maintainers to review something this small and standardized.<p>now that it's in a distro, it gets more traction. your distro (or a relative of it) decides they'd like to make SwayNC the default notification daemon for their users. but they want it to be consistent with the rest of the desktop, so they'll have to theme it a bit. peeking at the dependencies, they see it uses gtk, so they launch it with `GTK_DEBUG=interactive swaync` to view the document tree and modify the component styles until it fits in. SwayNC didn't have to do anything special to do that, maybe their devs didn't even know that feature existed -- they got it for free just by using a standard toolkit.<p>now i hope the author might understand why dbus/systemd/wayland are appealing to distros and packagers. there's a long chain between upstream/developer and downstream/user. i figure the author spends more time near the latter than the former. perhaps someday they'll experience the full cycle: maybe they'll find no music player meets their needs and decide to author their own, watch as it gets adopted into different downstreams without any action on their part, enjoy unexpected bug fixes and improvements that their users send back upstream, and walk away with a broader understanding of the different tradeoffs at play here.</p>"},{"id":"29af0550638e7b29","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by RetpolineDrama in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:29:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:29:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5665,"y":6484,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428150\n<hr>\n<p>>And zero-day spyware is usually targeted towards important individuals,<p>Yeah but have you ever had someone ImportantTM's old phone number?<p>What about their IP?</p>"},{"id":"2cd5fecc11d3c679","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by failuser in \"iOS 16.6.1 fixes two vulnerabilities known to be actively exploited in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:29:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:29:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4015,"y":2556,"wires":[["76771095e1031d10"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428149\n<hr>\n<p>I also wonder.

It was never realistic. The Death Star is a patently ridiculous, extremely inefficient weapon, since there's no need to entirely explode a planet to destroy it, as is it needing to wait until the moon of Yavin is out of the way when it could easily destroy Yavin from any axis, as is the trench run, which only exists at all because George Lucas ripped off a World War 2 movie, scene for scene, as is the plot twist of the exhaust port. Yes, it's been retconned (like the parsecs thing) but it's still goofy as hell that two torpedos could cause a chain reaction big enough to blow up an entire moon-sized ship even if it hit the reactor dead on.<p>The walkers in Empire Strikes Back are ridiculous, no one would actually build those, with their obvious (and easily exploited) weakness. And in a universe with blasters, no one would ever be using lightsabers.

And yes, the elephant in the room is that <i>any FTL drive is by definition a weapon of mass destruction.</i><p>None of it makes much sense. It never has, because it has always been more important that things look cool than make sense.

If you stop using WhatsApp for example, nothing bad happens if you try to send messages another way. But if you stop using iMessage, then you can't send a normal SMS to someone with whom you've communicated before using iMessage. The Messages app will tell you, \"You must enable iMessage to send this message\", even if it's an SMS text message to a normal phone number! What shouldn't that work?<p>The only explanation for this behavior that makes sense is lock-in. To be able to again send SMS text messages to someone you used to talk with is to disable iMessage of course, then sign out of Facetime (who could imagine that as a necessary step?), sign out of iCloud, reboot the iPhone, and wait some minutes to hours to days until you are \"deregistered\" from iMessage. I'm talking about the same phone with the same SIM chip. The problem can become much worse if you've switched phones or SIM card.</p>"},{"id":"2b868daff4a5f287","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by kevinherron in \"macOS users: what have you installed with brew?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:46:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:46:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5365,"y":1580,"wires":[["653725519dac8385"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428266\n<hr>\n<p>New system, not much so far:<p>kevin@Kevins-MacBook-Pro ~> brew leaves<p><pre><code>  fish\n\n  maven\n\n  rename</code></pre></p>"},{"id":"97513cd75b48250a","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by check89 in \"Tech workers now doubting decision to move from California to Texas\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:46:41 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:46:41 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7041,"y":6148,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428265\n<hr>\n<p>> Kyle Rittenhouse<p>Are you Pantifa creeps still upset he shot one of your pedophiles?</p>"},{"id":"809315936108027c","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by ShadowBanThis01 in \"AtariAge and Atari\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:46:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:46:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4590,"y":912,"wires":[["ec4fb8ddf8bb7ee7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428264\n<hr>\n<p>Cool, thanks for the reference!<p>In the early '90s I wanted to get some drawings I did with the Atari Touch Tablet into my Windows computers.

But to allow this sort of entity to operate from your soil in a commercial manner, including selling those exploits on the open market where they will inevitably be used against the home country as well seems 'optional' to me and there is a lot of Israelis that like their smartphones.<p>Why would an entity the size of Apple risk their reputation and everything they stand for to avoid a run-in with a relatively tiny company in a relatively small part of the world that is causing an enormous amount of problems?</p>"},{"id":"71d9ac79e91276c8","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by xerox13ster in \"Linux becoming a Windows / OS X clone\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:48:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:48:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2669,"y":1340,"wires":[["823532621931f121"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428277\n<hr>\n<p>Fam, you probably installed Discord through the package manager or the AUR and then when it said there was an update you said \"I'll figure it out\" and downloaded the tarball that option offers and built it.<p>you should remove them by doing `sudo pacman -Rns discord` followed by trying yay -R discord.<p>Then install it from either the AUR with yay or Arch repo with pacman.</p>"},{"id":"ef5206278719dae4","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by plaguuuuuu in \"North Korean campaign targeting security researchers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:47:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:47:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4190,"y":3020,"wires":[["30b6fee1a94433b6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428276\n<hr>\n<p>If you're a member of an elite cyber-intelligence military branch who knows, it might not be as bad.<p>The USA is also great if you earn 200k/y as a software developer.<p>If you're a teacher, not so much.</p>"},{"id":"6c9e90efb603c765","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by yjftsjthsd-h in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:57:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:57:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2673,"y":1396,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428339\n<hr>\n<p>That's mostly done client-side these days; having the server treat clients differently doesn't happen as much anymore.</p>"},{"id":"5227e86143b03e53","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by userbinator in \"North Korean campaign targeting security researchers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:57:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:57:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4190,"y":3052,"wires":[["30b6fee1a94433b6"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428338\n<hr>\n<p><i>But the tool also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled domain.</i><p>Also known as \"automatic updates\".

If you wanted to reliably build a $1mil rocket engine for a rocket like a falcon 9, you'd probably need $100mil in funding.<p>Maybe less if you were just literally recreating a white box version of a falcon 9 - most competitors are trying to do SOMETHING different. And doing something different can result in spending >$10mil and blowing all that up on the test pad, requiring you to go back to the drawing board with scared and pissed off investors.<p>Looking back at 2018, Rocket Lab secured $140 million in their series E financing. They had their first successful launch January 2018 and had 3 successful launches that year. Prior to those 3 successful launches, they had $148 million in investments.<p>So even that $100mil is an extremely sporty number. Given the series E funding, they'd need to sell 300 engines at $1mil a piece... and if the engines are reusable, that's what, a 20 year contract?<p>Anyway, the moral of the story here (from first hand experience lol) is that investors are finicky. So is experimental new rocket technology. If you want to make a new rocket you're going to blow a lot of money up.<p>The high risk and potentially low rate of return is why there aren't more rocket startups - and there's actually quite a few out there right now lol. Off the top of my head: rocketlab, astra, abl, relativity... and wikipedia shows me like 30 more companies...<p>But yea, getting that VC money to build a rocket is kinda hard. Also, if you want to fly people on it.. ..... heh... ... :D</p>"},{"id":"1823a03fbd46a899","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by coffeebeqn in \"California

McCarthy, Dartmouth College\nM. L. Minsky, Harvard University\nN. Rochester, I.B.M. Corporation\nC.E. Shannon, Bell Telephone Laboratories<p>August 31, 1955<p>We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.<p>The following are some aspects of the artificial intelligence problem:<p>1 Automatic Computers<p>If a machine can do a job, then an automatic calculator can be programmed to simulate the machine. The speeds and memory capacities of present computers may be insufficient to simulate many of the higher functions of the human brain, but the major obstacle is not lack of machine capacity, but our inability to write programs taking full advantage of what we have.<p>2. How Can a Computer be Programmed to Use a Language<p>It may be speculated that a large part of human thought consists of manipulating words according to rules of reasoning and rules of conjecture. From this point of view, forming a generalization consists of admitting a new word and some rules whereby sentences containing it imply and are implied by others. This idea has never been very precisely formulated nor have examples been worked out.<p>3. Neuron Nets<p>How can a set of (hypothetical) neurons be arranged so as to form concepts. Considerable theoretical and experimental work has been done on this problem by Uttley, Rashevsky and his group, Farley and Clark, Pitts and McCulloch, Minsky, Rochester and Holland, and others. Partial results have been obtained but the problem needs more theoretical work.<p>4. Theory of the Size of a Calculation<p>If we are given a well-defined problem (one for which it is possible to test mechanically whether or not a proposed answer is a valid answer) one way of solving it is to try all possible answers in order. This method is inefficient, and to exclude it one must have some criterion for efficiency of calculation. Some consideration will show that to get a measure of the efficiency of a calculation it is necessary to have on hand a method of measuring the complexity of calculating devices which in turn can be done if one has a theory of the complexity of functions. Some partial results on this problem have been obtained by Shannon, and also by McCarthy.<p>5. Self-lmprovement<p>Probably a truly intelligent machine will carry out activities which may best be described as self-improvement. Some schemes for doing this have been proposed and are worth further study. It seems likely that this question can be studied abstractly as well.<p>6. Abstractions<p>A number of types of ``abstraction'' can be distinctly defined and several others less distinctly. A direct attempt to classify these and to describe machine methods of forming abstractions from sensory and other data would seem worthwhile.<p>7. Randomness and Creativity<p>A fairly attractive and yet clearly incomplete conjecture is that the difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of a some randomness. The randomness must be guided by intuition to be efficient. In other words, the educated guess or the hunch include controlled randomness in otherwise orderly thinking.<p>In addition to the above collectively formulated problems for study, we have asked the individuals taking part to describe what they will work on. Statements by the four originators of the project are attached.<p>... <i>the paper continues</i> ...</p>"},{"id":"c21e3b37de6baf39","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by userbinator in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:01:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:01:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4129,"y":6196,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428355\n<hr>\n<p>Just like disabling JavaScript in the browser by default, or using LTSC versions of Windows --- it's propaganda to keep you on the path they want, and not the path you want, because there are powerful interests in the former direction.</p>"},{"id":"6bf6030318be4016","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by eru in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:01:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:01:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2673,"y":2884,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428354\n<hr>\n<p>I always thought Eigenvektor was borrowed from German, not Dutch?<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#History\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#H...</a> seems to confirm the German origins, citing David Hilbert and Hermann von Helmholtz as originators of the word.</p>"},{"id":"76433c74e616bc1e","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by bagels in \"Google gets its way, bakes a user-tracking ad platform directly into Chrome\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:01:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:01:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2280,"y":1836,"wires":[["65f1f071a145e8ee"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428353\n<hr>\n<p>Same playbook with apple vs Facebook</p>"},{"id":"df24a9f13a4d7c2f","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by zem in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3201,"y":2884,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428349\n<hr>\n<p>and \"uncle\" in hindi (mother's brother, specifically; hindi has different words for various kinds of uncle/aunt/grandparent depending on the path through the family tree)</p>"},{"id":"701b502f48802a45","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by tough in \"Google gets its way, bakes a user-tracking ad platform directly into Chrome\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2280,"y":1868,"wires":[["65f1f071a145e8ee"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428348\n<hr>\n<p>That just means a more powerful mafia boss in town so probably yeah</p>"},{"id":"606746c8727e6350","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by lossolo in \"Opposites don't actually attract: meta-analysis study\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4200,"y":684,"wires":[["2f24473aea14c24f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428347\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1279-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s1291...</a><p><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2013/retrieve.php?pdfid=133\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2013/retrieve.php?pdfid=13...</a><p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271373\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal...</a><p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0966369X.2011.624588\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0966369X.2011.62...</a></p>"},{"id":"a79cf94dd357b2ff","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by YZF in \"Blacksmithing is alive and well in Kentucky\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 01:59:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3729,"y":2884,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428346\n<hr>\n<p>I own a bandsaw and it doesn't scare me.

The carriers lack catapults, which means they can't really launch tankers (or any heavy aircraft at all). US Navy carriers almost always have at least one tanker up while conducting flight operations. This makes a huge difference in safety because an aircraft that gets into any trouble has an option to conduct aerial refueling instead of having to rush a carrier landing, or divert to a distant land base. The next generation of Chinese carriers are expected to have catapults but those are technically challenging. I'm sure that this is a priority area for their spies.</p>"},{"id":"3b7c8aca1b1b11dd","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by User23 in \"Opposites don't actually attract: meta-analysis study\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:12:23 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:12:23 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4200,"y":748,"wires":[["2f24473aea14c24f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428422\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"612504e8e9bcb764","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by rexpop in \"Show HN: HackYourNews – AI summaries of the top HN stories\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:12:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:12:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2155,"y":2316,"wires":[["9c46fa898b7b30e1"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428421\n<hr>\n<p>> Overall, the comments provide a mix of technical insights, personal experiences, and opinions on the topic.<p>Yeah, I'll bet.<p>At first blush, I find this uselessly verbose.

I do argue that your chosen definition entirely misses the point of what I was saying. Specifically this definition.<p><pre><code>  Definition Real := nat -> Digit\n</code></pre>\nMy definition of a Real is NOT a function from a nat to a Digit. It is a program that is SUPPOSED TO return a Digit when it gets a nat. Where \"supposed to\" means that there is a proof in the axiom system saying that it will.<p>This does not mean it actually will return a digit. Our axiom system might be broken. But we can claim to have a proof from our axiom system that it will.<p>Given an enumeration of such programs, a program representing your diagonalized function can be created. Your proof demonstrates that IF it always returns a Digit, THEN it will produce output that is different from anything on the list.<p>But does it always return a Digit? Just as before, maybe, maybe not. The new program waits on another program, and the other program might not return a Digit.<p>Before we could claim to have a proof in the axiom system that our program would return a digit. We now have less than that. What we now have is a proof that there is a proof in the axiom system that it will return a Digit. A proof of a proof is not actually a proof from the axiom system.<p>What we have does represent a proof in (axiom system + consistency of axiom system) that it will return a Digit. But this is a strictly weaker claim than we had before. And it is weaker by the fact that we now need a new axiom. Namely the axiom of the consistency of our previous axiom system. And consistency is necessary because we have to deal with the reference to the axiom system introduced through diagonalization.<p>If you still doubt, please don't bother arguing with me. Go ask your neighborhood mathematical logician. Then argue with them. You've clearly decided that I don't know what I'm talking about. But you haven't decided that of them, so they still have a chance.</p>"},{"id":"ce03d30ba6a0f384","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by albert_e in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:22:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:22:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4865,"y":3316,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428467\n<hr>\n<p>Some examples from India<p>Telugu/Kannada : mother is \"amma\"<p>Hindi: \"maa\"</p>"},{"id":"5d986a959d5c305a","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by shrubble in \"What it's Really Like to be an Alaskan Truck Driver\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:22:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:22:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1000,"y":1644,"wires":[["7ef07ef207ee9b87"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428466\n<hr>\n<p>Have you ever driven on icy gravel roads?</p>"},{"id":"66f892926475e91f","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by BearhatBeer in \"Rubber plumbing seals can leak additives into drinking water, study says\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:22:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:22:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1899,"y":2924,"wires":[["f585b90682b65af7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428465\n<hr>\n<p>I always run the water in the bathroom and kitchen until it's super cold, letting me know I've gotten to the stuff fresh out of the main.

No hate or disrespect to other pairings. I'm sure anthropologists and sociologists study this rigorously. These are just some random layman musings.<p>Just like in softwre engineering, I find human social systems fascinating. A recent example is the so-called \"Bama Rush\", which is rushing sororities at the University of Alabama, something I honestly probably never would've heard about were it not for Tiktok. Where I'm from we have nothing like Greek life so I find this fascinating.<p>UA is an SEC school. SEC schools are a sporting division for the NCAA. UA college football is a big feeder for the NFL. Non-Americans may not realize that the Ivy League too is a sporting designation, not an academic one.<p>Here are some things I learned:<p>1. UA itself is a feeder into Alabama politics, called The Machine [1];<p>2. Pre-Civil War southern society had a very rigid structure. Correct or not, I tend to refer to this as plantation society. This is the realm of cotillions and debutantes. This harkens back to Regency England and earlier. The concept of a \"debut\" isn't exclusive to the South but it's more pronounced (it seems);<p>3. \"Social proof\" is such a huge factor in all of this. So much of this is about either seeking upward social mobility or, in the very least, insuring against downward social mobility. Greek life is a part of this;<p>4. Traditionally women went to college to get what's referred to somewhat derisively as an \"MRS degree\" (ie to find a husband). This sort of thing happened in the North too where colleges had \"sister colleges\" (eg Radcliffe for Harvard, which didn't admit women 60 years ago).<p>Now I bring all this up because when I see comments about the importance of money (from other commenters and elsewhere), I think that's a very shallow (and basically incorrect) analysis. So much of matching in this environment is about social status and mobility. Power and money are proxies for that. You cannot ignore the importance of shared values in all of this.<p>Thing is, you see this same pattern play out even somewhere like NYC, which very much isn't \"plantation society\". There are various proxies for social status like what school you went to (high school and college), where you work, your social connections and so on.<p>In London, you see people reduce other people to what postcode they live in (eg W4, N1, etc).<p>In LA in particular but probably elsewhere, if you're friends with an A-lister, you will be able to get into exclusive clubs, restaurants, etc even if by yourself. Just that connection alone is sufficient.<p>You see a lot of these same themes play out in period fiction lkke Pride and Prejudice.<p>Now you may think this is all very transactional. To a point it is. Compatibility does factor into it too. But you also find so many people who \"settle\". Another way of putting this is that they have certain goals and they find a partner who is sufficient for that.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_(social_group)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_(social_group)</a></p>"},{"id":"20968cbb7ccb1054","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by aithrowaway in \"Ask HN: How are people getting around GPT4 rate limits?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:27:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:27:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6801,"y":5140,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428497\n<hr>\n<p>It doesn't seem like you're getting it.

For what it's worth, I agree with much of what you're saying as well.<p>Having grown up in a red state and having conservative leanings around self-reliance, even though at a national level I prefer some liberal bureaucracy to keep the system running, because that's beyond me. If the system worked as the founding fathers intended, we'd be able to rely on republican representation to take care of business for us so that we wouldn't have to be as personally involved democratically. The loss of that basic trust and civil discourse really irks me. Especially in recent years, as you said.<p>I don't have kids, but I have watched my more political friends on social media cool their jets a little since January 6, I think due to family pressure. It seems to be slowly dawning on them that the problems we're facing transcend politics. None of us want to leave future generations saddled with unplayable debts and environmental collapse. But sadly there's not much we can do about that in the short term. So we'll probably have to work through these wedge issues one by one and put it all on the table to reach some sort of consensus or compromise through political horse trading. And that's not a bad thing.<p>I keep writing and deleting this paragraph, so I think I'll just leave it at that. Thank you as well for responding in depth.

I always liked this review:<p>Critic David Ehrlich rated the film 9.7/10 and called it \"perhaps the greatest animated film ever made.\" He wrote: \"While initially jarring, Miyazaki's unapologetic deviations from fact help The Wind Rises to transcend the linearity of its expected structure, the film eventually revealing itself to be less of a biopic than it is a devastatingly honest lament for the corruption of beauty, and how invariably pathetic the human response to that loss must be. Miyazaki’s films are often preoccupied with absence, the value of things left behind and how the ghosts of beautiful things are traced onto our memories like the shadows of objects outlined by a nuclear flash. The Wind Rises looks back as only a culminating work can.\"</p>"},{"id":"2d8602e2aa5a0c87","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by nerdbaggy in \"Outage at Square prevents small businesses from accepting credit cards\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:47:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 02:47:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":843,"y":1940,"wires":[["cefcc39525d2613","f1257c4e43b250e5"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428614\n<hr>\n<p>Status page - <a href=\"https://www.issquareup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.issquareup.com/</a><p>So far it has been 8+ hours.

But we presumably have many of them spreading at the same time. If one of them has a very effective transmission mechanism (and isn’t violently deadly), it could contaminate most people (a little bit like what Covid presumably did). If among those people, some of them have an infection that can kill with a high likelihood, then the two have plenty of opportunities to combine. Or the first one could mutate on its own, favoring a slow, asymptomatic process.<p>How do you go from a very bad flu to an extinction? Well, we haven’t tried to do that at scale yet [That was a dark joke], but presumably with a very low percentage of death, Covid was able to disable our ability to obtain toilet paper, sail the Suez Canal, not drink bleach and horse dewormer, and enrich commercial real estate owners [I’ll stop with the jokes]. More seriously, our logistics were in the ditch for a while, and we realized we had very few factories for a lot of stuff that is essential for critical things—the plastic cap for the tiny glass vials that we put vaccines in? the tiny cardboard sticks used to hold the test to check if meat processing chains are clean? We had a lot of “I never thought that was a thing” moments. There’s a lot more to be had.<p>More deaths, especially through a slower mechanism, could block our ability to distribute some essential medicine, disinfectant, food, or even water. If some parents believe that their kids could be dying unless they obtain a compound that is in a protected facility, that facility could be breached—even if it’s all a hoax and that’s actually an insufficiently protected bio-security lab with live samples of a worse infection.<p>If you’ve seen any pandemic horror story, you’ve seen countless errors in judgment, from the billionaire fleeing to the last uninfected island, carrying the virus on board, to the scientist who missed an assumption, etc.<p>I’m praying that you are right, but *we don’t know* because (back to the sincerity behind that first joke) we have no idea if our genetic diversity protects us against any zoonotic infection. It’s a domain we understand in principle but have no way to acquire relevant scientific knowledge. Hence why this is a *new type of risk*.<p>Oppenheimer was able to say that the atomic bomb wouldn’t ignite N2 and the whole atmosphere. Imagine they knew this was a risk but couldn’t run the math because of uncertainty in quantum physics. Would the project be threatening in a completely new way?<p>To answer your question:<p>> I do not get how you are arriving at that conclusion.<p>You indeed can’t because I’m not reaching that conclusion, not formally. There are obvious gaps in my speculative reasoning. But those gaps are known unknowables. They currently seem impossible to disprove clearly.<p>This is why this was explained to me in a class about the philosophy of science, not microbiology.</p>"},{"id":"b77830749e6ef66b","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by cdchn in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:12:36 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:12:36 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3361,"y":5188,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428777\n<hr>\n<p>Lots of people would be blocked iMessaging each other TIF images.</p>"},{"id":"3a78f123f9262e1","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by JohnBooty in \"Google gets its way, bakes a user-tracking ad platform directly into Chrome\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:12:27 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:12:27 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2280,"y":3852,"wires":[["65f1f071a145e8ee"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428775\n<hr>\n<p>Nah.

Especially if their current workflow is writing a script then pressing run button in Matlab or calling python my_script.py, then they do julia my_script.jl and they expect it to work the same way as Python or Matlab do. This is why in all the user & developer survey TTFP is consistently ranked highest.<p>As a research software engineer, I've seen PhDs and postdocs that are downright scared of programming and any kind of low level technical work in general, even if their problem domain requires high performance languages. They just want their project or thesis to finish within their probably unrealistic deadlines. You throw them to a language with strict type checking or traits and interfaces and they will just give up. Unfortunately if the language users are filled with these kind of user then it results to this kind of problems, which you did mentioned in your second paragraph.<p>> It is incredibly hard to reason about this language if every developer is not willing to commit to understanding and writing Julia code the right way (e.g. type stable, dispatch via the type system, actually defining interfaces). Given the target demographic of academics, the proportion of people interested in grokking Julia is vastly smaller than the number of academics who hear \"walks like Python runs like C\" and decide this is their new, free, hip MATLAB/SciPy replacement.<p>Thinking about it, to solve this Julia problem we need to solve academics scared of programming problem.

Doug sent me a note, saying that my review was the fairest and the most painful.  The reason why it was painful is that I pointed out all the unsolved problems they were still working on.

Stream works fantastic on 23.04, but I have problems login in to some games on 22.10. Having problems using Cuda on 23.04 but it works 100% on 22.10, and on and on it goes. Did go back to 22.04, but there were other problems then, so decided 22.10 will be it for now. As so many people said before, Linux is 95% there, it is just the last 5% that is so frustrating.</p>"},{"id":"524b752e74c5a25f","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by eru in \"A BERT for laptops, from scratch\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:33:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:33:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2937,"y":1452,"wires":[["239674a521042025"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428917\n<hr>\n<p>I used to use Gentoo in the past (now on Archlinux).

They had a common custom CI system that all services used, and that actually worked quite well (much nicer than Jenkins). And Square really only had 3 languages that were acceptable to use for services (Java, Ruby, and Golang; node.js being phased out). I remember interviewing people at other larger companies and finding they didn't have things we had at Square in 2014, like a common way of configuring and registering services, or an easy way to see what's running on a particular box, or service-to-service ACLs, or a tool to coordinate online schema changes.

It sits in the \"money for AI\" fund from me. Ie it competes with ChatGPT. While it uses OpenAI in the background, i have not found it to be as complete and useful as ChatGPT directly. I did cancel ChatGPT for a couple months to try out Phind instead because Phind can search, and i find that missing from ChatGPT of course (at least until they have the module back). I'm on the pro plan of Phind, fwiw.<p>Hypothetically it could (maybe, i'm assuming) be as valuable for my ChatGPT use cases, but i found that i couldn't just give it the same input i'd give ChatGPT, as Phind would then search for an answer and come back with.. well, things from the internet which wasn't what i was wanting from that ChatGPT interface. I struggle to think of an example, though.. so hopefully this vague description is still of use hah.<p>2. Where Phind excels of course is digging answers out of the web, finding API solutions, wiring those results up into code, etc. However unfortunately this still seems a complex task. I do not find Phind to be accurate enough. It usually does a decent job at inferring the solution from the results, but it struggles with knowing library versions, context of the search results, etc.<p>I find myself using Phind primarily as a quick jumping off point for search results.. but i still often need to still search myself to figure out the actual code. So when i feel like i still need to search anyway, <i>and</i> that i feel i gave up ChatGPT for Phind (due to item #1), then it's just a tough position to justify Phind over CGPT for me.<p>For context usually i'm using and searching about Rust.<p>Fwiw i've still not decided one way or another.

You could just say to junior team members/contributors that the project uses git-flow and send them the link to the doc.<p>I applied git-flow to my projects but simplified the process, eventually abandoning almost all its principles. It did give me a starting point to think about what we really needed, what is important and how to communicate it with a team.<p>One particular process I am quite fond of is to use the develop branch as a free for all integration/testing branch with automated deployment to a test (dev) environment with absolutely no guarantee of working whatsoever to any stake holder.  This allows devs to demo their work, collaborate and spot conflicts early, without being slowed down by fear of breaking something or waiting for a code review.<p>Unlike git-flow, that develop branch is a dead end. It does not get merged to master or any other branch ever and gets force-push (reset) when things go wrong.<p>Feature branches eventually get proper code review, their history can be cleaned up and eventually merged (or dropped) via a proper pull request.</p>"},{"id":"d63cbf74760fa725","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by dang in \"Show HN: Yggdrasil 1.0 – Native executables for Shen\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:56:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:56:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6321,"y":4228,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429094\n<hr>\n<p>Recent and related:<p><i>Yggdrasil: The grand unification of programming languages</i> - <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37322122\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37322122</a> - Aug 2023 (3 comments)</p>"},{"id":"38b1ca43f778fcdb","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by yett in \"Searx is no longer maintained\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:56:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:56:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":973,"y":2340,"wires":[["8c09e4a8b3a8fb7e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429093\n<hr>\n<p>I've usually clicked on the links that Phind provides as a source.

Instead I search for all of them at once with the same breadth-first search. Even without those algorithmic optimizations, it can find a 17-move solution---like the following puzzle from Nov. 25th, 2022 (the 'r' square is the goal for the red robot)---in about 30 seconds on my laptop using less than 400 MB of memory.

For most problems, most of the pages in that table will never even get mapped, but at worst the whole thing is 128 MB. There are probably clever ways to permute the indices of the robot positions to get better cache coherency in the table lookups, but I did not bother.<p>The state in the breadth-first search queue is just the 32-bit combined robot positions. No back-pointers are stored to recover the solution(s). Instead, a side-table keeps track of the index in the queue where the number of moves increases (since all entries are ordered by the number of moves required to get there), and upon reaching a goal the solution is recovered by back-tracking one move at a time and searching the whole queue for a state plus a move that gets us to the next state. This sounds slow (and it is!), but it is actually faster than storing back-pointers in the queue. The queue size grows exponentially with the number of moves¹, but you do not need to search for the last move in your solution, because you were just making it when you reached that goal. So you avoid having to read through the majority of the queue just by skipping that last level, and you avoid having to <i>write</i> the extra data for the whole queue. Assuming your back pointer would have been a 32-bit queue index, that cuts the data written in half. You also don't have to check the \"visited states\" table during back-tracking, so you avoid lots of cache pressure that was present when filling the queue the first time.<p>¹: At least for long enough to reach any single robot goal... if you search for all reachable <i>combinations</i> of robot positions, eventually you run out of unvisited states and the number of newly reachable states starts shrinking again until it hits almost nothing, at somewhere approaching 100 moves. For a given board, roughly 2/3rds of the 3,937,437,000 possible combinations of robot positions are reachable, giving a maximum memory usage of about 10 GB.</p>"},{"id":"52a097f945d30246","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by alephnerd in \"I rode with an ice road trucker to the Arctic Circle\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:05:48 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:05:48 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6929,"y":4228,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429165\n<hr>\n<p>Alaska is massive, and their commodities driven economy is what allows them to provide UBI to all their residents.</p>"},{"id":"33b1484af337094b","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by mikepavone in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:05:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:05:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4377,"y":3748,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429164\n<hr>\n<p>These are recent loanwords though which the OP considered uninteresting</p>"},{"id":"b5c83f29bbb8492b","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by BearhatBeer in \"Linux becoming a Windows / OS X clone\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:05:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:05:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2669,"y":1628,"wires":[["823532621931f121"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429163\n<hr>\n<p>It's all gotten too complicated, clearly the direction of Linux is controlled by big companies who are mainly interested in the datacenter.

It is so easy to split them apart again after your team grows to the point where it matters, but before that point you will need to carefully coordinate merging PRs to multiple repos, and sometimes rolling them back, and it is so easy with a small application monorepo. You can just store git’s “tree hashes” in s3 and check if they changed when deciding whether to build and deploy, it's not hard.<p>- If you're versioning, a version.txt file at the root of the versioned content is your friend. Have a {subproject_name}-v1.6 branch, you tag commits on that branch v1.6.3-rc1, rc2, ... automatically with CI/CD, until you tag one RC as a release when you release it.<p>- Everyone merges into main, you cherrypick from main out to those other branches. This keeps the graph clean. When you cut v1.6 you decide whether your next project on main is v2.0 or v1.7.<p>- Feature toggles are your friend, see Rod Hilton’s Three-Flow[1]. Just clean them up when you release!<p>- with about a day's involvement in CI/CD, the `main` branch can have a `k8s/` folder with subfolders for each of your deployment environments. You want to deploy something to prod, just update a version number in `k8s/prod` and merge to `main`. This is even a little simpler than Three-Flow and you can very precisely answer when something was shipped.<p>- folders `rfc/` and `docs/` and `issues/` at the root level would be amazing but I can't get any company to actually do them. One stop shopping! Why not? Once `main` is authoritatively central, it becomes a great place for these things, just the same as you use it for `k8s/prod` and `k8s/dev`.<p>- The underlying point of all of this is to make sure that everybody merges their code every day. If that would break something, put the breakage behind a feature toggle. If it's a config file that doesn't have feature toggles, run the C preprocessor on it or invest in Dhall or some other hack. Do whatever you can so that there is one big conversation happening, and everybody is collaborating. The worst is when you have these huge merge conflicts, the second worst is when you have been doing a lot of work and someone else sweeps it all away before you merge, \"oh I didn't see you working on that so I solved it in this inferior hacky way.\"<p>1. <a href=\"https://www.rodhilton.com/2017/04/09/a-different-branching-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.rodhilton.com/2017/04/09/a-different-branching-s...</a></p>"},{"id":"d5b0f6d3ad2717d8","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by Horffupolde in \"What's new in Emacs 29.1\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:11:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:11:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6577,"y":2308,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429205\n<hr>\n<p>I don’t like how you can’t reason about commands.

Super nice and super retired. She can still climb stairs, but not for a lot longer.<p>This is a question about how poor elderly people survive in the USA metro areas.<p>We are in Oakland. Mary is my neighbor.<p>Mary has about $3,000 in her bank account, which is barely enough for rent around here. She lives on SSI benefits [1].<p>But suddenly she got a letter saying she was suspended from SSI.<p>Plus a $19,000 fee.<p>The reason they gave: because her bank account was over $2,000.<p>Turns out, yep, extremely strict, fixed limit. If you go over this limit even barely, you can be penalized. The limit is two. thousand. dollars.<p>They are saying they overpaid her and now she has to pay it back.<p>They say she was over the limit for a year, which was true — she could have easily hidden the assets if she were trying to commit a crime. (As if having $3k could be a crime.)<p>Turns out this limit has not been inflation adjusted since 1970s.<p>Apparently it is the strictest limits of their kind in the USA. [2]<p>The strict limit clearly discourages people from saving. I mean, it literally <i>prohibits</i> savings.<p>And now just when her income goes down to zero, she will get a new bill to pay every month. Absolutely punishing!<p>She is poor and harmless, she really did nothing wrong and this feels like a life-threatening policy failure.<p>What can I specifically do to help Mary?<p>This is devastating for her and may really leave her homeless. It is impossible for me to tell how to approach the SSI bureaucracy. She has no lawyer or advocate, and we don't know what to do except to ask around.<p>So, any feedback would be welcome from folks who have experience with this or can give pointers to other relevant resources, thanks.<p>Should we contest the case and what kind of logic would be persuasive to this machine?<p>[1] https://www.ssa.gov/ssi\n[2] https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/the-case-for-updating-ssi-asset-limits</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429228\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429228</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"3c7b42f7fd187405","type":"subflow:372fb8dd2dbd40f7","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"At the U.S. Open, that voice yelling 'Out' comes from a computer (2021)","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:10:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:10:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4317,"y":3412,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/us-open-that-voice-yelling-out-comes-computer-2021-09-03/\">https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/us-open-that-voice-yelling-out-comes-computer-2021-09-03/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429199\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429199</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"56bd2338879a6102","type":"subflow:372fb8dd2dbd40f7","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"Contra Chrome","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:09:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:09:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4829,"y":1060,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://contrachrome.com/\">https://contrachrome.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429195\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429195</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"8a188c4d487dfc87","type":"subflow:372fb8dd2dbd40f7","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"Apple Becomes the Biggest U.S.-China Pawn Yet","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:07:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:07:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5529,"y":1732,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-becomes-the-biggest-u-s-china-pawn-yet-ad093256\">https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-becomes-the-biggest-u-s-china-pawn-yet-ad093256</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429175\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429175</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"ec233295d153aa62","type":"subflow:13270bb8783e37bc","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"The International Criminal Court Will Now Prosecute Cyberwar Crimes","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:42:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 03:42:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1245,"y":3012,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/icc-cyberwar-crimes/\">https://www.wired.com/story/icc-cyberwar-crimes/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428975\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428975</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"7c54530a7792cfdf","type":"subflow:13270bb8783e37bc","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"Square is down","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:39:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:39:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4912,"y":636,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.issquareup.com\">https://www.issquareup.com</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37423593\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37423593</a></p>\n<p>Points: 38</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>"},{"id":"c88972f29e0cd5ec","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by imiric in \"Chrome now tracks users and shares a \"topic\" list with advertisers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:21:43 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:21:43 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":5425,"y":5188,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429284\n<hr>\n<p>Firefox is barely surviving.

And 2) it is generally difficult to write software for embedded systems because the peripherals are all over the place.  There is no “one framework to rule them all”, so you need to relearn how to do basic tasks for every new system you use.<p>I feel like 1 is getting to be much less of a blocker for a huge variety of applications.  Most hobbyists don’t even bother with the dedicated built in “spi” pins, they just do spi bit banging on whatever pins they want to use because they don’t have a performance reason to worry about it.<p>2 is still an issue, and is largely what arduino was trying to solve (for hobbyists at least), by creating a standardized set of tools and libraries.<p>From that perspective, there is still a lot of work to be done.  Modern languages can offer a huge amount of zero cost abstractions for things like HALs, if you can make it easy enough to write the underlying translation layers so you can actually run on the combinatoric explosion of different software options out there.  If arduino can make that kind of thing possible, I would assume they could make inroads into the professional world.</p>"},{"id":"38bcc33d54f555af","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by matheusmoreira in \"Kagi Small Web\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:20:05 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 04:20:05 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":770,"y":4912,"wires":[["2e83f8f43693b570"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429270\n<hr>\n<p>Same.

It's doubly so considering 1/2 above.</p>"},{"id":"9dba937cdc210960","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by Nowado in \"LLMs, RAG, and the missing storage layer for AI\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:22 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:22 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":923,"y":2356,"wires":[["f32f4831c8d21aa2"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429678\n<hr>\n<p>Interesting, do you happen to have some quantitative results on this/additional insights/etc?<p>I've interpreted transformer vector similarity as 'likelihood to be followed by the same thing' which is <i>close</i> to word2vec's 'sum of likelihoods of all words to be replaced by the other set' (kinda), but also very different in some contexts.</p>"},{"id":"ee468851b1da9596","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by skybrian in \"Chrome now tracks users and shares a \"topic\" list with advertisers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3381,"y":5860,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429677\n<hr>\n<p>Are these subtopics somehow not shown in Chrome settings, or did it not find any?</p>"},{"id":"34f65bb40d3c25e","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by chatmasta in \"iOS 17 sideloading support is coming, and Apple can’t stop it\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1161,"y":2380,"wires":[["2f0c3faeab4002b5"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429676\n<hr>\n<p>I wonder how this will affect apps like Apollo, which can still run fine if you use your own API key, but wouldn't be able to publish compliantly on the App Store while giving users the capability to use their own key (since it violates Reddit TOS).</p>"},{"id":"55a0df5e8c75a76a","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by baby in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:22:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":7489,"y":5236,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429675\n<hr>\n<p>or you know, use Rust</p>"},{"id":"e64a2699636975da","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by HDThoreaun in \"Chicago’s parking meter disaster\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:21:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:21:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":6369,"y":2980,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429674\n<hr>\n<p>There are many in Chicago</p>"},{"id":"d4acae02fc77fc44","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by nxobject in \"Grindr Loses Almost Half Its Staff on 2-Day RTO Requirement\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:21:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:21:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":8177,"y":5236,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429673\n<hr>\n<p>That's amazing – it's strange that I never noticed that.

Despite these successes, their development faces two main challenges: (i) high computational cost; and (ii) difficulty in conducting fair and objective evaluations. LLMs are prohibitively expensive, making it feasible for only a few major players to undertake their training, thereby constraining both research and application opportunities. This underscores the importance of cost-effective LLM training. In this paper, we utilize a growth strategy to significantly reduce LLM training cost. We demonstrate that an LLM with 101B parameters and 0.31TB tokens can be trained on a $100K budget. We also adopt a systematic evaluation paradigm for the IQ evaluation of LLMs, in complement to existing evaluations that focus more on knowledge-oriented abilities. We introduce our benchmark including evaluations on important aspects of intelligence including symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference. Such evaluations minimize the potential impact of memorization. Experimental results show that our model FLM-101B, trained with a budget of $100K, achieves comparable performance to powerful and well-known models, e.g., GPT-3 and GLM-130B, especially in the IQ benchmark evaluations with contexts unseen in training data.

Thats some nice fan fiction. Look at how Elon is torpedoing himself even further trying to take on ADL(lets be frank they clearly have ties to Israel).

All the way from state governments passing laws saying you cannot boycott Israel or else you'll be barred from contracts(Anti-BDS laws) to congress removing members from their committees if they criticize Israel(eg. Illhan Omar) and signing loyalty pledges to Israel. When ANY new resistance appears against Israel, multiple groups in all of these countries move at light speed to enact a response.<p>The downsides of having these exploits is clearly acceptable to all the people that make the decisions. And it's not like a regular person can use these exploits against members of congress to make them feel the pain. They'll just 'Julian Assange' you.<p>What you are proposing requires massive reform at ALL level of government and across the western world as this is not only a US problem. Good luck with that.<p>This requires changing fundamental beliefs of the majority of people who vote in these governments. They have a special \"bond\" with Israel and they wont willingly let go of that.

Myanmar airforce has 100+ PRC airframes, variety of models in the last 30 years with little issue. Pretty much the only useful piece of info so far is Myanmar doesn't have adequate experience operating tech in 4th gen fighters, most of their fleet is 3rd gen. IIRC Myanmar got the jets before they even got simluators, and then bought 4th gen trainers (JL9) from PRC.<p>>Thailand<p>Yuan subs aren't operational because PRC couldn't acquire original specified German engines after EU sanctions. There's a period where Thai Navy was deciding whether to accept PRC engines, which they did. Some analysts implied if Thai did not accept PRC engines it would imply they were unsuitable, even more retarded media then spung that as technical issues with PRC engines. Both complete misinformation narratives since there's no basis for evaluating those unintegrated PRC engines at all.<p>>aircraft carriers<p>Training carriers based off RU design that analysis suggest PRC has more or less maximized sortie potential vs when USSR was running carrier ops on similar flight deck. Late 2022 USNI analysis on PRC carrier ops is they're basically reached \"true\" blue water deployment, i.e. a few hundred nms near Guam, 1000nm+ from mainland, with no divert airfrields or aerial refueling as backup. Which is about as far as PRC none nuke carriers need to deploy given strategic considerations. Caveate being conservative sorties and pretty clean (light) load outs to compensate for lack of divertion and ski jump. The struggle with PRC carriers is they won't have catapults and capabilites that brings until 003 and training was hectic because they only had 1-2 carriers training 3-4 crew rotations, somewhat alleviated by converted cruise/barrack ships. Would not characterie as overall carrier ops capabilities as struggling as limited by hardware, which TBH is expected since carriers does not seem particularly high priority outside of prestige. Basically most US analysis of various PRC military modernization is they're lacking and focusing on XYZ, but should get there in a few years. Occasionally throw in the word struggle because they watch CCTV7 where miltiary propaganda talks about how hard they work. A few years later, new analysis that they got there (i.e. asw, jointness), something something evolving, modernizing at astonishing rate, but here's the new struggle. Rinse and repeat. Combined with customary but no real combat experience (which no one has in modern peer warfare). But the underlying pattern if you look at meat of improvements year by year is PLA modernizing fast.</p>"},{"id":"994f7c39b2d86b9c","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by ShellfishMeme in \"California moves to decriminalize use of magic mushrooms, other psychedelics\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:47:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:47:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":420,"y":2304,"wires":[["969e7100ca298a79"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429855\n<hr>\n<p>Is there any proof that people trying to fly and jumping off a building is actually real?

CoreGraphics frameworks are likely not sandboxed themselves. So memory corruption there could still lead to privilege escalation.<p><pre><code>  * The CoreGraphics frameworks like CGImage are core system libraries that predate Apple's sandboxing technologies. They were likely not designed with sandboxing in mind.\n  * These graphics libraries need to be able to access hardware acceleration features like OpenGL/Metal, read and write image files, and render to the screen. Sandboxing them would likely break many of those features.\n  * Apple may have determined that completely sandboxing mature system frameworks like CoreGraphics would impose too much performance overhead across the OS.\n  * As a result, for backwards compatibility and performance reasons, Apple seems to have exempted these core graphics libraries from being sandboxed processes.\n</code></pre>\n- The sandbox profile may allow more syscalls or access than necessary. The syscall filter is still in \"permissive\" mode. So kernel escalation could still be possible.<p>- Payload encryption and upload to iCloud bypasses blastdoor. So compromise of an external service could have allowed running outside the sandbox.</p>"},{"id":"a5b6ab6336247f0e","type":"subflow:1646420c189eea83","z":"e055bd83936a828b","name":"New comment by yakubin in \"Are any words the same in all languages?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:49:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 05:49:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3769,"y":3508,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37429879\n<hr>\n<p>Where the “thea” part comes from Chinese.
