# FlowHub: Gists for Node-RED

FlowHub provides a [gist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist)-like service for [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) making it possible to quickly share flows.

Flows can be copied directly from FlowHub.org or imported using the [FlowHub nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@gregoriusrippenstein/node-red-contrib-flowhub).

At the moment, to upload a flow an API token is required. To obtain and token, please send an [email](mailto:request.apitoken@flowhub.org) explaining what, why, when, how, and whether you would like to use FlowHub for. For more details, please have a <a href="https://discourse.nodered.org/t/flowhub-org-gists-for-node-red/80215">read of the authors</a> reasoning for FlowHub.org.

## Goals

FlowHub aims to promote visual programming by providing tools that every programmer would expect from a programming language. FlowHub.org explores what it means to apply concepts such as refactoring, design patterns, unit tests, code sharing and version control in the context of a visual programming environment such as Node-RED. 

Years of textual-based programming has created a body of concepts, wisdoms and best-practices that must be transported and applied in a visual-based programming environment. Some of these ideas might prove to become redundant in a visual environment and new ideas will arise, the best fit remains to be found.

## License

All flows found here are licensed under the [don't do evil license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorenje/flows.flowhub.org/main/LICENSE).

**Usage of FlowHub.org implies an adherence to that license.**.

## Repository

All flows are hosted at GitHub in [flows.flowhub.org](https://github.com/gorenje/flows.flowhub.org) which is a public repository.


## Flows

A [complete collection](https://flows.flowhub.org/feed.xml) of flows is available, they cover a broad spectrum of Node-RED functionality.
