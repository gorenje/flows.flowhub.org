# FlowHub: Gists for Node-RED

FlowHub provides a [gist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist)-like service for [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) making it possible to quickly share flows.

Flows can be copied directly from FlowHub.org or imported using the [FlowHub nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@gregoriusrippenstein/node-red-contrib-flowhub).

At the moment, to upload a flow an API token is required. To obtain and token, please send an [email](mailto:request.apitoken@flowhub.org) explaining what, why, when, how, and whether you would like to use FlowHub for. For more details, please have a <a href="https://discourse.nodered.org/t/flowhub-org-gists-for-node-red/80215">read of the authors</a> reasoning for FlowHub.org.
