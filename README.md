# FlowHub: Visual Node-RED code sharing

[FlowHub.org](https://flowhub.org) is an experimental platform for *visually* sharing Node-RED code. 

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is a visual development platform providing several *textual* alternatives for sharing code. Reusable Node-RED nodes are created using a mixture of HTML, JavaScript and JSON, uploaded to the [NPM](https://npmjs.org) package sharing platform and then included in the [Node-RED library](https://flows.nodered.org/). 

This process of creating nodes is textual, no supporting tools are provided to do this visually. Yet within Node-RED these nodes can easily be installed and wired together - visually. A set of nodes thus wired together are called flows and it is these flows that can be shared via FlowHub.

Flows can be copied, downloaded or imported directly from FlowHub.org. Import flows directly into Node-RED using the [FlowHub nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@gregoriusrippenstein/node-red-contrib-flowhub). Flows can be uploaded using those nodes either with an API token or a valid email address.

## Goals

FlowHub aims to promote visual programming by providing tools that every programmer would expect from a programming language. FlowHub.org explores what it means to apply concepts such as refactoring, design patterns, unit tests, code sharing and version control in the context of a visual programming environment such as Node-RED. 

Years of textual-based programming has created a body of concepts, wisdoms and best-practices that must be transported and applied in a visual-based programming environment. Some of these ideas might prove to become redundant in a visual environment and new ideas will arise, the best fit remains to be found.
