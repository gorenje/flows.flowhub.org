# FlowHub: Gists for Node-RED

FlowHub provides a [gist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist)-like service for Node-RED making it possible to quickly share flows.

Flows can be copied directly from FlowHub.org or imported using the [FlowHub nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@gregoriusrippenstein/node-red-contrib-flowhub).

At the moment upload is limited to [email request only](mailto:request.apitoken@flowhub.org).

## License

All flows found here are licensed under the [don't do evil license](https://cdn.openmindmap.org/LICENSE.txt).

**Usage of FlowHub.org implies an adherence to that license.**.

## Repository

All flows are hosted at [flows.flowhub.org](https://github.com/gorenje/flows.flowhub.org).
