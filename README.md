# FlowHub: Gists for Node-RED

FlowHub provides a [gist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist)-like service for Node-RED making it possible to quickly share flows.

Flows can be copied directly from FlowHub.org or imported using the [FlowHub nodes]().

Upload is limited - at the moment - to [invitation only](mailto:apitoken@flowhub.org).

## License

All flows found here are licensed under the [don't do evil license](https://cdn.openmindmap.org/LICENSE.txt).

**Usage of this site implies an adherence to that license**.

## Repository

All flows are hosted at [flows.flowhub.org](https://github.com/gorenje/flows.flowhub.org).
