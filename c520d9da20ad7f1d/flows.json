A kind of ETL pipeline using Node-RED.\n\n**This is work in progress.**\n\n### FAQs\n\n*Why Open Sanctions?*\n\nBecause their [codebase](https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/tree/main) is open source and all their [dataset sources](https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/tree/main/datasets) are well documented - both for the human and for the machine.\n\n*Why do this in the first place?*\n\nCouple interesting issues arise: \n\n- can Node-RED handle all the different data formats?\n- can Node-RED provide the same functionality as a Python data crawler?\n- how best to use the existing data - the yaml specifications?\n\nThere are no best practices (that I know of) for doing this in Node-RED, so lets see if it will blend!\n\n*Different data formats, what different formats?*\n\n- <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='6faae8a6a0d1e37a'>JSON</a>\n- <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='793df5246ed23927'>XML</a>\n- <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='d4eef68edc7d60ba'>Excel .xsl</a>\n- <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='873c249985349886'>Excel .xslx</a>\n- <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='7faba8c7cfc07bb5'>Zip with CSV + Json</a>\n- <a class='ahl-group-only' data-ids='164e6cd0e78e06db'>sparql queries</a>\n\n*How to represent a large codebase?*\n\nAnother uncertainity that will arise is the representation of a large collection of data sources. How does one organise the flows, the subflows, modifications to existing nodes, etc.\n\n*Of course all of this already exists in Python form, why do it again?*\n\nNode-RED is a completely different paradigm to Python and perhaps there are advantages, as there are disadvantages in using Node-RED but what are they?\n","env":[]},{"id":"7faba8c7cfc07bb5","type":"group","z":"c520d9da20ad7f1d","name":"https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/tree/main/datasets/kp/rusi_reports","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["9f66185f5115641b","0231b43f62f94a44","69fc44f421efbf84","6da05d7a183bce78","d47aeb3680af0f53","5e963ebea0393011","011ba7a5692c127c","68e2e157cb47bad1","2c5c37db8114b8a3","072a152092fbdb93","5df417ba0090dcb9","1cbfb9d4624bc469","9db4b0986e590493","f8d8b5c0dc13492c","82d3965c87073975","cbb617ce49e18f08","8105ed7385b51ca4"],"x":1195,"y":590,"w":1015,"h":768,"info":"https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/tree/main/datasets/kp/rusi_reports"},{"id":"96c48b4780af3ad0","type":"group","z":"c520d9da20ad7f1d","name":"Package:
