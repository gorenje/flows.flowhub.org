These two nodes are the simplest of both types: <a class=\"ahl-node-only\" data-ids=\"2753c156ed96d617\">inject node</a> is the input and the <a class=\"ahl-node-only\" data-ids=\"501a10d8cc90b363\">debug node</a> displays the output.\n\nTogether these two nodes form a *flow*. They are also grouped together by the *group* labelled <a class=\"ahl-group-only\" data-ids=\"14f2336960b44447\">hello world</a>. The *wire* between the <a class=\"ahl-link-node\" data-ids=\"2753c156ed96d617,501a10d8cc90b363\">two nodes</a> shows the flow of the data: from the inject node to the debug node.\n\nThe inject node has a button (not shown here but in Node-RED) which when pressed will generate input, in this case, the string `hello world`. The debug node will simply display that string in the *debug panel* within Node-RED. \n\nBut: this won't happen until the flow has been *deployed*. Deploying a flow means transporting it to the server which executes flows. \n\nNode-RED is a classic client-server architecture with the browser being the client and the server being wherever Node-RED was installed. All changes to flows must first be deployed to the server to be executed there.\n\n:::\n\n","env":[]},{"id":"14f2336960b44447","type":"group","z":"7bac2d969ad2969f","name":"hello world","style":{"label":true},"nodes":["2753c156ed96d617","501a10d8cc90b363"],"x":383,"y":346,"w":436,"h":82},{"id":"2753c156ed96d617","type":"inject","z":"7bac2d969ad2969f","g":"14f2336960b44447","name":"inject","props":[{"p":"payload"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"hello world","payloadType":"str","x":479,"y":387,"wires":[["501a10d8cc90b363"]]},{"id":"501a10d8cc90b363","type":"debug","z":"7bac2d969ad2969f","g":"14f2336960b44447","name":"output","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"payload","targetType":"msg","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":723,"y":387,"wires":[]}]
