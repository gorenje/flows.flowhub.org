That was a last minute decision. In retrospect I think what pushed me over the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall. The density of startup people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the weather was so nice. I remembered that from living there in the 90s. Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. I wanted YC to be the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. So doing the winter batch in California seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice and the ambitious one were the same.</i><p>> <i>If we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would have been in Berkeley. That was our favorite part of the Bay Area. But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley. We didn't have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View. Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the ideal place to put something like YC. But even then we barely made it. The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.</i> [0]<p>and, from 2007:<p>> <i>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is not even a nationalistic one. It's the same thing I say to startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every 6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to move to Silicon Valley.

But you'll have slow responses and typically a 3rd party running the inference.<p>Annotating data yourself to about 2000-3000 examples, on the datasets that I ran my benchmarks on, may get you closer to 80-90%.

In fact, I think you could probably just learn both of them on top of what you're doing in Rust since the time investment is negligible compared to it in the long run.<p>With regards to the upsides in terms of writing code in a performance-aware manner:<p>- It's easier to look at a piece of code and confidently say it's not doing any odd or potentially bad things with regards to performance in both Odin and Zig<p>- Both languages emphasize custom allocators which are a great boon to both application simplicity, flexibility and performance (set up limited memory space temporarily and make sure we can never use more, set up entire arenas that can be reclaimed or reused entirely, segment your resources up in different allocators that can't possibly interfere with eachother and have their own memory space guaranteed, etc.)<p>- No one can use one-at-a-time constructs like RAII/`Drop` behind your back so you don't have to worry about stupid magic happening when things go out of scope that might completely ruin your cache, etc.<p>To borrow an argument from Rust proponents, you should be thinking about these things (allocation patterns) anyway and you're doing yourself a disservice by leaving them up to magic or just doing them wrong. If your language can't do what Odin and Zig does (pass them around, and in Odin you can inherit them from the calling scope which coupled with passing them around gives you incredible freedom) then you probably should try one where you can and where the ecosystem is based on that assumption.<p>My personal experience with first Zig and later Odin is that they've provided the absolute most productive experience I've ever had when it comes to the code that I had to write. I had to write more code in because both ecosystems are tiny and I don't really like extra dependencies regardless. Being able to actually write your dependencies yourself but have it be such a productive experience is liberating in so many ways.<p>Odin is my personal winner in the race between Odin and Zig. It's a very close race but there are some key features in Odin that make it win out in the end:<p>- There is an implicit `context` parameter primarily used for passing around allocator and a logger that can be implicitly used for calls if you don't specify one. This makes your code less chatty and let's you talk only about the important things in some cases. I still prefer to be explicit about allocators in most plumbing but I'll set `context.allocator` to some appropriate choice for smaller programs in `main` and let it go<p>- We can have proper tagged unions as errors and the language is built around it. This gives you code that looks and behaves a lot like you'll be used to with `Result` and `Option` in Rust, with the same benefits.<p>- Errors are just values but the last value in a multiple-value-return function is understood as the error position if needed so we avoid the `if error != nil { ... }` that would otherwise exist if the language wasn't made for this. We can instead use proper error values (that can be tagged unions) and `or_return`, i.e.:<p><pre><code>    doing_things :: proc() ParsingError {\n        parsed_data := parse_config_file(filename) or_return\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf we wanted to inspect the error this would instead be:<p><pre><code>    // The zero value for a union is `nil` by default and the language understands this\n    ParsingError :: union {\n        UnparsableHeader,\n        UnparsableBody,\n    }\n\n    UnparsableHeader :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    UnparsableBody :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    doing_things :: proc() {\n        parsed_data, parsing_error := parse_config_file(filename)\n        // `p in parsing_error` here unpacks the tag of the union\n        // Notably there are no actual \"constructors\" like in Haskell\n        // and so a type can be part of many different unions with no syntax changes\n        // for checking for it.\n        switch p in parsing_error {\n        case UnparsableHeader:\n            // In this scope we have an `UnparsableHeader`\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_header(p)\n        case UnparsableBody:\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_body(p)\n        }\n\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n- ZVI or \"zero-value initialization\" means that all values are by default zero-initialized and have to have zero-values. The entire language and ecosystem is built around this idea and it works terrifically to allow you to actually talk only about the things that are important, once again.</p>"},{"id":"3ce51bafcee2517a","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by aap_ in \"The Development of the C Language (2003)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":676,"y":452,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443379\n<hr>\n<p>What's fascinating is that I recently found some code that I believe was written in NB [1].

The toll road is for general traffic and as the name suggests requires paying a toll to use. The access road is only for use by traffic to/from the airport and is toll free. Using the access road to avoid paying the toll is illegal, but this is exactly what Google Maps has begun to suggest.

The idea is to fork, then LD_PRELOAD the other program and overwrite its read functions (and equivalents to also capture inlined read functions). The child process loads some solver which will try to read its input from STDIN. The overwritten read is triggered and instead of just reading, our library shim connects to the parent process. The parent process feeds the child with data, the shim converting the data into text, feeding it to the solver as if it would be reading from a file. Now once we are finished with stating the problem and want to query it (i.e. send assumptions, in QBF or SAT solver speech), we issue a fork command, which lets the child process fork again into a second process, while the solver program thinks it is still in the read() call. We then feed the assumptions only to this grandchild, close its STDIN, and return the result to the calling parent process. When there's another assumption, we can issue the fork again and send assumptions to the new instance, never having to process the full problem again\nThis is nice when the formula is large and the assumptions are small and numerous, which (e.g. for parallelization) was very useful in our research.\nThe copy on write nature of fork() of course also helps, effectively reducing the required RAM to keep solvers in memory. \nThe best of all this, it works remarkably well on Linux and is even (mostly) POSIX conforming!\nCheck out our paper: <a href=\"https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf</a>\nOr just the code: <a href=\"https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi\">https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi</a></p>"},{"id":"beb2978c04618625","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by michaelteter in \"JIT-optimized Ruby can outperform a C extension\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2092,"y":1124,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443493\n<hr>\n<p>I think the point of the essay is that we shouldn’t immediately assume that going to C is the best way to speed up part of a Ruby system.<p>It might be conventional wisdom to break out to C for the speed gain, but a purpose made, hand written piece of Ruby, with JIT optimizations, and be a better/faster solution.</p>"},{"id":"dc953edefa4a4fdc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by eastbound in \"North Korean campaign targeting security researchers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-420,"y":1348,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443492\n<hr>\n<p>As a startup delivering executables to customers, I decently trust most programs running in the company: Gimp, Libreoffice, Docker, IntelliJ… There are only 4 major things that download unchecked stuff and run them:<p>- IntelliJ plugins,<p>- Maven,<p>- NPM,<p>- GitHub Actions.<p>Jetbrains says it carefully reviews the source code of all versions of all plugins, and Maven has a somewhat decent dependency tree that you can restrict to major actors (Spring-Apache-Google).<p>Maybe the key to trust would be to have larger pieces of code (such as Spring) with quite a lot of process to check-in code, rather than a thousand NPM packages.

Peratt interpreted dotted circles and concentric circles as bottom-up renditions of a diocotron instability affecting the hollow outer sheets of the z-pinch (Peratt 2003:1209–1210,1212), while he derived ‘ladders’, ‘caterpillars’, ‘birds on sticks’, ‘squattermen’, ‘Kokopelli’, and many other forms from instabilities in the solid inner core of the lower segment of the auroral beam, viewed sideways or at an oblique angle (Peratt 2003:1193–1205).
