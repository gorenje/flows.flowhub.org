That was a last minute decision. In retrospect I think what pushed me over the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall. The density of startup people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the weather was so nice. I remembered that from living there in the 90s. Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. I wanted YC to be the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. So doing the winter batch in California seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice and the ambitious one were the same.</i><p>> <i>If we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would have been in Berkeley. That was our favorite part of the Bay Area. But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley. We didn't have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View. Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the ideal place to put something like YC. But even then we barely made it. The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.</i> [0]<p>and, from 2007:<p>> <i>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is not even a nationalistic one. It's the same thing I say to startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every 6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to move to Silicon Valley.

That's not nothing and it's something that you can get started with super quickly. But you'll have slow responses and typically a 3rd party running the inference.<p>Annotating data yourself to about 2000-3000 examples, on the datasets that I ran my benchmarks on, may get you closer to 80-90%. You'll typically also get fast inference that you can run on your own hardware no problem.

In fact, I think you could probably just learn both of them on top of what you're doing in Rust since the time investment is negligible compared to it in the long run.<p>With regards to the upsides in terms of writing code in a performance-aware manner:<p>- It's easier to look at a piece of code and confidently say it's not doing any odd or potentially bad things with regards to performance in both Odin and Zig<p>- Both languages emphasize custom allocators which are a great boon to both application simplicity, flexibility and performance (set up limited memory space temporarily and make sure we can never use more, set up entire arenas that can be reclaimed or reused entirely, segment your resources up in different allocators that can't possibly interfere with eachother and have their own memory space guaranteed, etc.)<p>- No one can use one-at-a-time constructs like RAII/`Drop` behind your back so you don't have to worry about stupid magic happening when things go out of scope that might completely ruin your cache, etc.<p>To borrow an argument from Rust proponents, you should be thinking about these things (allocation patterns) anyway and you're doing yourself a disservice by leaving them up to magic or just doing them wrong. If your language can't do what Odin and Zig does (pass them around, and in Odin you can inherit them from the calling scope which coupled with passing them around gives you incredible freedom) then you probably should try one where you can and where the ecosystem is based on that assumption.<p>My personal experience with first Zig and later Odin is that they've provided the absolute most productive experience I've ever had when it comes to the code that I had to write. I had to write more code in because both ecosystems are tiny and I don't really like extra dependencies regardless. Being able to actually write your dependencies yourself but have it be such a productive experience is liberating in so many ways.<p>Odin is my personal winner in the race between Odin and Zig. It's a very close race but there are some key features in Odin that make it win out in the end:<p>- There is an implicit `context` parameter primarily used for passing around allocator and a logger that can be implicitly used for calls if you don't specify one. This makes your code less chatty and let's you talk only about the important things in some cases. I still prefer to be explicit about allocators in most plumbing but I'll set `context.allocator` to some appropriate choice for smaller programs in `main` and let it go<p>- We can have proper tagged unions as errors and the language is built around it. This gives you code that looks and behaves a lot like you'll be used to with `Result` and `Option` in Rust, with the same benefits.<p>- Errors are just values but the last value in a multiple-value-return function is understood as the error position if needed so we avoid the `if error != nil { ... }` that would otherwise exist if the language wasn't made for this. We can instead use proper error values (that can be tagged unions) and `or_return`, i.e.:<p><pre><code>    doing_things :: proc() ParsingError {\n        parsed_data := parse_config_file(filename) or_return\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf we wanted to inspect the error this would instead be:<p><pre><code>    // The zero value for a union is `nil` by default and the language understands this\n    ParsingError :: union {\n        UnparsableHeader,\n        UnparsableBody,\n    }\n\n    UnparsableHeader :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    UnparsableBody :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    doing_things :: proc() {\n        parsed_data, parsing_error := parse_config_file(filename)\n        // `p in parsing_error` here unpacks the tag of the union\n        // Notably there are no actual \"constructors\" like in Haskell\n        // and so a type can be part of many different unions with no syntax changes\n        // for checking for it.\n        switch p in parsing_error {\n        case UnparsableHeader:\n            // In this scope we have an `UnparsableHeader`\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_header(p)\n        case UnparsableBody:\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_body(p)\n        }\n\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n- ZVI or \"zero-value initialization\" means that all values are by default zero-initialized and have to have zero-values. The entire language and ecosystem is built around this idea and it works terrifically to allow you to actually talk only about the things that are important, once again.</p>"},{"id":"3ce51bafcee2517a","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by aap_ in \"The Development of the C Language (2003)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2064,"y":396,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443379\n<hr>\n<p>What's fascinating is that I recently found some code that I believe was written in NB [1].

I live near Dulles Airport in Northern Virginia. Heading to/from the airport are two roads which until you get near the airport follow the same route. The Dulles Toll Road and the Dulles Access Road. The toll road is for general traffic and as the name suggests requires paying a toll to use. The access road is only for use by traffic to/from the airport and is toll free. Using the access road to avoid paying the toll is illegal, but this is exactly what Google Maps has begun to suggest.

The idea is to fork, then LD_PRELOAD the other program and overwrite its read functions (and equivalents to also capture inlined read functions). The child process loads some solver which will try to read its input from STDIN. The overwritten read is triggered and instead of just reading, our library shim connects to the parent process. The parent process feeds the child with data, the shim converting the data into text, feeding it to the solver as if it would be reading from a file. Now once we are finished with stating the problem and want to query it (i.e. send assumptions, in QBF or SAT solver speech), we issue a fork command, which lets the child process fork again into a second process, while the solver program thinks it is still in the read() call. We then feed the assumptions only to this grandchild, close its STDIN, and return the result to the calling parent process. When there's another assumption, we can issue the fork again and send assumptions to the new instance, never having to process the full problem again\nThis is nice when the formula is large and the assumptions are small and numerous, which (e.g. for parallelization) was very useful in our research.\nThe copy on write nature of fork() of course also helps, effectively reducing the required RAM to keep solvers in memory. \nThe best of all this, it works remarkably well on Linux and is even (mostly) POSIX conforming!\nCheck out our paper: <a href=\"https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf</a>\nOr just the code: <a href=\"https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi\">https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi</a></p>"},{"id":"beb2978c04618625","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by michaelteter in \"JIT-optimized Ruby can outperform a C extension\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1436,"y":1236,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443493\n<hr>\n<p>I think the point of the essay is that we shouldn’t immediately assume that going to C is the best way to speed up part of a Ruby system.<p>It might be conventional wisdom to break out to C for the speed gain, but a purpose made, hand written piece of Ruby, with JIT optimizations, and be a better/faster solution.</p>"},{"id":"dc953edefa4a4fdc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by eastbound in \"North Korean campaign targeting security researchers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1416,"y":1460,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443492\n<hr>\n<p>As a startup delivering executables to customers, I decently trust most programs running in the company: Gimp, Libreoffice, Docker, IntelliJ… There are only 4 major things that download unchecked stuff and run them:<p>- IntelliJ plugins,<p>- Maven,<p>- NPM,<p>- GitHub Actions.<p>Jetbrains says it carefully reviews the source code of all versions of all plugins, and Maven has a somewhat decent dependency tree that you can restrict to major actors (Spring-Apache-Google).<p>Maybe the key to trust would be to have larger pieces of code (such as Spring) with quite a lot of process to check-in code, rather than a thousand NPM packages.

Text search and highlighting, where you need to do things like performing word stemming or lemmatization on the search input, find matching documents, and highlight spans.<p>Also, LLMs have a different tokenization model, so you have tokens like \"don\"/\"'t!\" -- this makes them difficult to work with in downstream NLP applications where having words, numbers, punctuation, and symbols as specific tokens are more useful.<p>NLP is not a solved task, as things like part of speech classification (identifying nouns, adjectives, etc.) are not 100% accurate, and tend to have a lower sentence accuracy compared to word accuracy.</p>"},{"id":"e08c079aeaf3e8fd","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by soneil in \"Consumers defrauded on Zelle are left high and dry by the banks that created it [pdf]\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-448,"y":2468,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443614\n<hr>\n<p>I assume everyone's familiar with the overpayment scam - it's probably the second most common cheque scam after simply passing bad cheques in the first place.  You're accidentally paid too much, and are asked to return the remainder, or pass it on to someone else.  Then the original cheque bounces and you're out product plus the remainder you passed along.<p>This version relies on banks being required to make \"funds available\" in a timeframe that's often shorter than how long it takes a cheque to actually clear - so you can dig yourself into a hole before the cheque finally bounces.<p>The zelle version is essentially the same thing.  Someone \"accidentally\" sends you a sum, and being a nice, reasonable person, you return it.  The problem is this isn't a rollback; you don't (can't) revert their transaction - you create a second transaction.<p>So when the source of the original transaction turns out to be fraudulent - and as the parent post says, fraudulent can be reverted, the house always wins - that first transaction is reverted. The second, where you \"returned\" their overpayment, is an entirely distinct transaction and needs to be fought separately.  And it's a much harder fight to win, because it doesn't involve the house winning.<p>(And yes, this could be almost entirely mitigated by having a user-facing return/revert/refund function that undoes the original transaction instead of creating a second.)</p>"},{"id":"e207884d0c027dad","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by kprotty in \"Maybe Rust isn’t a good tool for massively concurrent, userspace software\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1926.2804988841208,"y":1704.6045706599195,"wires":[["3ca3b54616f901f2"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443612\n<hr>\n<p>To run async in Drop in rust, you need to use block_on() as you can't natively await (unlike in Go).

They are still slower than <i>not</i> going through the boundary at all, naturally, but that’s about it. On the other hand, going through the Lua/C API inherited from the original, interpreted implementation—which sounds similar to what the Ruby blog post is comparing pure-Ruby code to—<i>can</i> be quite slow.<p>The SWC situation I can’t understand quickly, but apart from the WASM overhead it sounds to me like they have a syntax tree that the JS plugin side really wants to be GCed in the GC’s memory but the Rust-on-WASM host side really wants to be refcounted in WASM memory, and that is indeed not a good situation to be in. It took a decade or more for DOM manipulation in JS to not suck, and there the native-code side was operating with deep hooks into the VM and GC infrastructure as opposed to the WASM straitjacket. Hopefully it’ll become easier when the WASM GC proposal finally materializes and people figure out how to make Rust target it.<p>In any case, it puzzles me how hard it is in just about any low-level language to cheaply integrate with a GC. Getting a stack map out of a compiler in order to know where the references to GC-land are and when they are alive is like pulling teeth. I don’t think it should be that way.</p>"},{"id":"a3f503f06adf25e6","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by marcomourao in \"LogoScale – A method for vectorizing small, crappy logos\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:50:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:50:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":720,"y":-384,"wires":[["71823eccadcfff0d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443697\n<hr>\n<p>I'm a graphic designer and Vector Magic[1] still is my gold standard for vectorizing logos.

Once in my career I encountered something similar. The first interesting thing I learned about promissory estoppel was that it wasn’t really “law” but rather a legal concept. As such, things are a bit more vague than the typical legal dispute.<p>Secondly, the lawyer told me that it was only possible to take that route if one had not officially signed an employment contract. The reasoning is that once you’ve signed a contract, you’re technically an employee and your claim would be handled in a different manner. But in many jurisdictions, the wronged person would be treated as having been fired at will and would not have much recourse (as opposed to a promissory estoppel claim)<p>The other concepts in play were common sense things, like the company had to made you a reasonable offer, you took reasonable actions based on that promise, and the company knew you were taking those actions. And finally, the “penalty” is often only the documented losses you really incurred which can seem tiny in comparison to the situation and intangible losses. I suspect many of these cases are settled before going to court.<p>IANAL and YMMV</p>"},{"id":"6cd9c74130e26920","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by manishmshiva in \"What Is Cybersecurity Forensics?

It has no legitimate interest in mandating statistical data-collection about online speech, either: because there's no legitimate government function that data serves and informs.

Does this make it easier to see how (0) indirect laws about speech (i.e. mandatory statistics) intrinsically have chilling effects on that speech, and (1) \"mere data-collection\" about speech doesn't obviously serve any legitimate government function? (Political signalling isn't a legitimate government function).

Introduction of namespaces is an improvement but it does not change the fact that everything is in global scope. The best practice for imports is to not include them outside of execution context, but it also makes it very hard to reason about what is actually being used by the file + you try to think about not loading files unnecessarily so it's not uncommon to add the import statement in the same file multiple times before using something and there are no type hints that say whether the include was imported or not. Which is more or less a consquence of the environment not having a proper runtime and everything being re-initialized with every request (in a runtime context, all files that would ever by used would be included, because they would be used eventually). I genuinely wonder how it came to be that a language developed specifically to serve web requests is not a loop, you would think that a runtime would be especially useful for handling requests and Facebook learned it the hard way, heck CLI input -> output programs are probably the only type of program where it would not be a limitation.</p>"},{"id":"2af8335a3458edcc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by narism in \"Teen’s death after eating a single chip highlights risks of ultra-spicy foods\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:19:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:19:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":572,"y":236,"wires":[["6a04b3ef5b4f4cfd"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443825\n<hr>\n<p>The source/other articles [1][2][3] mention this particular chip has sent multiple other students to the hospital before.

I always doubted these figures (I'm a PHP dev myself, so I wouldn't mind these figures being true).\nI think the methodology is shady. I wonder if they use what the server indicates. I think some servers like Apache with php mod send this information to the client in a header. But most servers don't. Therefore they maybe use this as \"from all the servers giving a backend language information, PHP represents 77%\" which wouldn't be surprising. The question is how many websites in your data don't give any information about the language used under the hood?<p>I think we should stop using these numbers. GitHub uses ruby on rails but we know it from the developer team, not from what the server tells us. How many websites communicate about their backend infrastructure?<p>I don't doubt Wordpress powers many websites out there. But I'm tired of these figures which don't mean anything to me. Especially that if you look for all job ads, PHP isn't so big (except in some PHP-centric countries like France).<p>You can't just make up numbers. If you give me statistics, give me the methodology you used and all the details. Otherwise I suggest we all start to say Haskell powers 87% of the web.

LLMs can mean a bunch of different things, people call models the size of BERT LLMs sometimes. So let's talk specifically about in-context learning (ICL) with either zero or a few examples. So we'll say LLM ICL, and contrast that with techniques where you annotate enough data to train with, which might only be something like 10-40 hours of annotation. The something you do with that data is probably training a task-specific classification model initialised with weights from a language modelling objective. This is sometimes called \"fine-tuning\", but fine-tuning can also mean taking an LLM and adapting its ICL. So we'll just call it \"training\", and the fact you use transfer learning like BERT or even word vectors is just tactics.<p>Okay. So, here's something that might surprise you: ICL actually sucks at most predictive tasks currently. Let's take NER. Performance on NER on some datasets is _below 2003_. Here's some recent discussion: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mayhewsw/status/1700139745769046409\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/mayhewsw/status/1700139745769046409</a><p>The discussion focusses on how bad the CoNLL 2003 dataset is, and indeed it's a crap dataset. But experiments have also been done on other datasets, e.g. check out the comparison of ICL and training in this paper from Microsoft: <a href=\"https://universal-ner.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://universal-ner.github.io/</a> . When GPT4 is used this one paper reports it slightly better on some tasks: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092</a> . Frustratingly they don't do enough GPT4 experiments. This other paper also does a huge number of experiments, but not with GPT4: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092</a><p>The findings across the literature are really clear. ICL is generally much worse than training a model in accuracy, and you generally don't need much training data to get there.<p>For tasks like text classification, ICL sometimes does okay. But you need to pick the problem characteristics carefully. Most text classification tasks people actually want to do have something like 20 labels, the texts are kind of long, and the labels don't capture the category especially well. Applying ICL to such tasks is very non-trivial. Your prompt balloons up if you have lots of classes to predict between, and providing the examples is hard if your texts are even a few hundred words.<p>Let's say you want to do something <i>ultra</i> simple: classify articles into categories for some news site or blog. This is the type of problem text classifiers have been eating for breakfast for 20 years. This is not a difficult problem -- a unigram bag of words does fine, and the method of estimating the weights can be almost anything, like just averaged perceptron will be totally okay.<p>But how will an LLM be able to do this? Probably your topic categories include several different types of article under it. If you know what those types of article are you can separate them out and make sure they're represented in the prompt. But now we're back at needing a tonne of domain knowledge about your problem -- that's like having to write custom features to make your model work. We all switched to deep learning so we wouldn't have to do that.<p>LLMs build a much more sophisticated representation of the meaning of the data to classify. But then you give them very few examples of the <i>problem</i>. So they can only build a shallow function from this deep representation. If you have lots of examples, you can learn a complex function from shallower features. For a great many classification tasks, this is better. The rest of your system usually needs the classification module to have some sort of consistent behaviours anyway. To do that, you basically have to make an annotation manual, and then you want to annotate evaluation documents. Once you're there the effort to make training data and train a model is minimal.<p>The other elephant in the room is the expense of the LLM solutions. The papers are missing results on GPT4 not because they're lazy, but because it's so expensive to use GPT4 as a classification solution that they want to get the rest of their results out the door.<p>The world cannot migrate all its current NLP models for text classification and NER to ICL. There are nowhere near enough GPUs in the world for that to happen. And I don't know about you, but I expect the number of text classification and NER models to <i>grow</i>, not shrink. So, the idea that we'll stop training small models for these tasks is just implausible. The OpenAI models that support batching are almost viable for prediction, but models like GPT4 don't support it (perhaps due to the mixture of experts?), so it's super slow.<p>The other thing is, many aspects of language that are useful as annotations are consistent linguistic features. The English language codes for proper names and numeric entities. They behave differently in the grammar. So some sort of named entity annotation can be done once, and then the model trained and reused. This is what spaCy does. We do this for a variety of other useful annotations across languages. We actually need to do much more: we need to collect new annotations for these models to keep them up to date, and we need to do this for more tasks, such as semantic role labelling. But it's definitely a good way to reuse work. We can do this annotation once, train the models, and users can reuse the models.<p>The strength of ICL is that you can get started very easily, without doing the work of annotation and training. There's lots of research on making ICL few-shot learning less bad on arbitrary text classification, NER and other tasks. We're working hard to take these results from the literature and build best-practice prompts and parsers you can use as a drop-in annotation module in spaCy: <a href=\"https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm\">https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm</a> . Our annotation tool Prodigy also supports initializing the annotations from an LLM, and just correcting the output: <a href=\"https://prodigy.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://prodigy.ai</a> . The idea is to let you start with an LLM, and then transition to a model you train yourself, which can be run much faster.</p>"},{"id":"d38238c58b04ee2f","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by dash2 in \"The PGP Problem (2019)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2586,"y":-1284,"wires":[["5d67fb7e0ef8c8b5"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443920\n<hr>\n<p>This seems like part of a more general phenomenon: shonky or outdated 2000s open source software getting in the way of progress.</p>"},{"id":"2cd231df68f6a5f4","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by IdiranVibe in \"Safety inspector fired for finding 'too many defects'\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1436,"y":1348,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443919\n<hr>\n<p>> at most city speeds<p>This is exactly it!

I'll cede the argument about the e-commerce platforms and CRMs, but I'm just not convinced that PHP is where a budding developer should be focusing their efforts. You enter the business/corporate world and there are tons of applications out there running the world, not just websites. Those applications are predominantly written in languages like .NET, Java, JS/ECMAScript, Python, Rust, and Go. Also, among the managed languages like .NET/Java/JS the knowledge is quite transferrable and sometimes almost identically named.<p>I'm not trying to bash PHP as a language, but every time I see this argument it's the same. Evangelizing PHP also seems to come with a requirement to mention Wordpress, Wikipedia, and Facebook. I'm sure there's money to be made in PHP, and I'm sure it's a great language for the internet. But learning .NET or Java is likely to have a much larger window of opportunity. Also, if you have a specific industry you want to work in you should be looking at the language predominately sought after in that industry.<p>I think this is why a lot of developers bash PHP, it's not that it's a non-valid choice. It's that it has limited applicability.
