That was a last minute decision. In retrospect I think what pushed me over the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall. The density of startup people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the weather was so nice. I remembered that from living there in the 90s. Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. I wanted YC to be the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. So doing the winter batch in California seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice and the ambitious one were the same.</i><p>> <i>If we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would have been in Berkeley. That was our favorite part of the Bay Area. But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley. We didn't have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View. Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the ideal place to put something like YC. But even then we barely made it. The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.</i> [0]<p>and, from 2007:<p>> <i>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is not even a nationalistic one. It's the same thing I say to startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every 6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to move to Silicon Valley.

But you'll have slow responses and typically a 3rd party running the inference.<p>Annotating data yourself to about 2000-3000 examples, on the datasets that I ran my benchmarks on, may get you closer to 80-90%.

This yields performance comfortably comparable to optimized Node.js apps.<p>In general, PHP has a highly optimized runtime, and we didn’t even really touch caching yet. Trust me when I say performance is not one of the problems PHP poses :)</p>"},{"id":"4c19422d8dca8543","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by yreg in \"On the 10th anniversary of the Snowden revelations\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:28:20 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:28:20 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5352,"y":-1260,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443325\n<hr>\n<p>So it is a total lie that it was \"the biggest source of traffic\".</p>"},{"id":"334d42799032bc0f","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by satisfice in \"Housewives Are One Surprising Solution to “Millennial Burnout”\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:27:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:27:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4664,"y":564,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443324\n<hr>\n<p>I recommend this lifestyle.</p>"},{"id":"cdd6d12f6eb1734d","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by ozim in \"Aardvark'd: The Fog Creek documentary, 18 years later\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:37:31 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:37:31 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":360.88691931262883,"y":885.9549240767174,"wires":[["786ff371bcb6f2fa"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443370\n<hr>\n<p>I think that is my main issue with \"Business Analysts\" I have to work with.

In fact, I think you could probably just learn both of them on top of what you're doing in Rust since the time investment is negligible compared to it in the long run.<p>With regards to the upsides in terms of writing code in a performance-aware manner:<p>- It's easier to look at a piece of code and confidently say it's not doing any odd or potentially bad things with regards to performance in both Odin and Zig<p>- Both languages emphasize custom allocators which are a great boon to both application simplicity, flexibility and performance (set up limited memory space temporarily and make sure we can never use more, set up entire arenas that can be reclaimed or reused entirely, segment your resources up in different allocators that can't possibly interfere with eachother and have their own memory space guaranteed, etc.)<p>- No one can use one-at-a-time constructs like RAII/`Drop` behind your back so you don't have to worry about stupid magic happening when things go out of scope that might completely ruin your cache, etc.<p>To borrow an argument from Rust proponents, you should be thinking about these things (allocation patterns) anyway and you're doing yourself a disservice by leaving them up to magic or just doing them wrong. If your language can't do what Odin and Zig does (pass them around, and in Odin you can inherit them from the calling scope which coupled with passing them around gives you incredible freedom) then you probably should try one where you can and where the ecosystem is based on that assumption.<p>My personal experience with first Zig and later Odin is that they've provided the absolute most productive experience I've ever had when it comes to the code that I had to write. I had to write more code in because both ecosystems are tiny and I don't really like extra dependencies regardless. Being able to actually write your dependencies yourself but have it be such a productive experience is liberating in so many ways.<p>Odin is my personal winner in the race between Odin and Zig. It's a very close race but there are some key features in Odin that make it win out in the end:<p>- There is an implicit `context` parameter primarily used for passing around allocator and a logger that can be implicitly used for calls if you don't specify one. This makes your code less chatty and let's you talk only about the important things in some cases. I still prefer to be explicit about allocators in most plumbing but I'll set `context.allocator` to some appropriate choice for smaller programs in `main` and let it go<p>- We can have proper tagged unions as errors and the language is built around it. This gives you code that looks and behaves a lot like you'll be used to with `Result` and `Option` in Rust, with the same benefits.<p>- Errors are just values but the last value in a multiple-value-return function is understood as the error position if needed so we avoid the `if error != nil { ... }` that would otherwise exist if the language wasn't made for this. We can instead use proper error values (that can be tagged unions) and `or_return`, i.e.:<p><pre><code>    doing_things :: proc() ParsingError {\n        parsed_data := parse_config_file(filename) or_return\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf we wanted to inspect the error this would instead be:<p><pre><code>    // The zero value for a union is `nil` by default and the language understands this\n    ParsingError :: union {\n        UnparsableHeader,\n        UnparsableBody,\n    }\n\n    UnparsableHeader :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    UnparsableBody :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    doing_things :: proc() {\n        parsed_data, parsing_error := parse_config_file(filename)\n        // `p in parsing_error` here unpacks the tag of the union\n        // Notably there are no actual \"constructors\" like in Haskell\n        // and so a type can be part of many different unions with no syntax changes\n        // for checking for it.\n        switch p in parsing_error {\n        case UnparsableHeader:\n            // In this scope we have an `UnparsableHeader`\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_header(p)\n        case UnparsableBody:\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_body(p)\n        }\n\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n- ZVI or \"zero-value initialization\" means that all values are by default zero-initialized and have to have zero-values. The entire language and ecosystem is built around this idea and it works terrifically to allow you to actually talk only about the things that are important, once again.</p>"},{"id":"3ce51bafcee2517a","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by aap_ in \"The Development of the C Language (2003)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":128,"y":-2100,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443379\n<hr>\n<p>What's fascinating is that I recently found some code that I believe was written in NB [1].

The toll road is for general traffic and as the name suggests requires paying a toll to use. The access road is only for use by traffic to/from the airport and is toll free. Using the access road to avoid paying the toll is illegal, but this is exactly what Google Maps has begun to suggest.

The idea is to fork, then LD_PRELOAD the other program and overwrite its read functions (and equivalents to also capture inlined read functions). The child process loads some solver which will try to read its input from STDIN. The overwritten read is triggered and instead of just reading, our library shim connects to the parent process. The parent process feeds the child with data, the shim converting the data into text, feeding it to the solver as if it would be reading from a file. Now once we are finished with stating the problem and want to query it (i.e. send assumptions, in QBF or SAT solver speech), we issue a fork command, which lets the child process fork again into a second process, while the solver program thinks it is still in the read() call. We then feed the assumptions only to this grandchild, close its STDIN, and return the result to the calling parent process. When there's another assumption, we can issue the fork again and send assumptions to the new instance, never having to process the full problem again\nThis is nice when the formula is large and the assumptions are small and numerous, which (e.g. for parallelization) was very useful in our research.\nThe copy on write nature of fork() of course also helps, effectively reducing the required RAM to keep solvers in memory. \nThe best of all this, it works remarkably well on Linux and is even (mostly) POSIX conforming!\nCheck out our paper: <a href=\"https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf</a>\nOr just the code: <a href=\"https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi\">https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi</a></p>"},{"id":"beb2978c04618625","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by michaelteter in \"JIT-optimized Ruby can outperform a C extension\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1556,"y":-572,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443493\n<hr>\n<p>I think the point of the essay is that we shouldn’t immediately assume that going to C is the best way to speed up part of a Ruby system.<p>It might be conventional wisdom to break out to C for the speed gain, but a purpose made, hand written piece of Ruby, with JIT optimizations, and be a better/faster solution.</p>"},{"id":"dc953edefa4a4fdc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by eastbound in \"North Korean campaign targeting security researchers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1464,"y":-284,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443492\n<hr>\n<p>As a startup delivering executables to customers, I decently trust most programs running in the company: Gimp, Libreoffice, Docker, IntelliJ… There are only 4 major things that download unchecked stuff and run them:<p>- IntelliJ plugins,<p>- Maven,<p>- NPM,<p>- GitHub Actions.<p>Jetbrains says it carefully reviews the source code of all versions of all plugins, and Maven has a somewhat decent dependency tree that you can restrict to major actors (Spring-Apache-Google).<p>Maybe the key to trust would be to have larger pieces of code (such as Spring) with quite a lot of process to check-in code, rather than a thousand NPM packages.

You're accidentally paid too much, and are asked to return the remainder, or pass it on to someone else.  Then the original cheque bounces and you're out product plus the remainder you passed along.<p>This version relies on banks being required to make \"funds available\" in a timeframe that's often shorter than how long it takes a cheque to actually clear - so you can dig yourself into a hole before the cheque finally bounces.<p>The zelle version is essentially the same thing.  Someone \"accidentally\" sends you a sum, and being a nice, reasonable person, you return it.

They are still slower than <i>not</i> going through the boundary at all, naturally, but that’s about it. On the other hand, going through the Lua/C API inherited from the original, interpreted implementation—which sounds similar to what the Ruby blog post is comparing pure-Ruby code to—<i>can</i> be quite slow.<p>The SWC situation I can’t understand quickly, but apart from the WASM overhead it sounds to me like they have a syntax tree that the JS plugin side really wants to be GCed in the GC’s memory but the Rust-on-WASM host side really wants to be refcounted in WASM memory, and that is indeed not a good situation to be in. It took a decade or more for DOM manipulation in JS to not suck, and there the native-code side was operating with deep hooks into the VM and GC infrastructure as opposed to the WASM straitjacket. Hopefully it’ll become easier when the WASM GC proposal finally materializes and people figure out how to make Rust target it.<p>In any case, it puzzles me how hard it is in just about any low-level language to cheaply integrate with a GC. Getting a stack map out of a compiler in order to know where the references to GC-land are and when they are alive is like pulling teeth. I don’t think it should be that way.</p>"},{"id":"a3f503f06adf25e6","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by marcomourao in \"LogoScale – A method for vectorizing small, crappy logos\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:50:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:50:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":720,"y":-444,"wires":[["71823eccadcfff0d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443697\n<hr>\n<p>I'm a graphic designer and Vector Magic[1] still is my gold standard for vectorizing logos.

Once in my career I encountered something similar. The first interesting thing I learned about promissory estoppel was that it wasn’t really “law” but rather a legal concept. As such, things are a bit more vague than the typical legal dispute.<p>Secondly, the lawyer told me that it was only possible to take that route if one had not officially signed an employment contract. The reasoning is that once you’ve signed a contract, you’re technically an employee and your claim would be handled in a different manner. But in many jurisdictions, the wronged person would be treated as having been fired at will and would not have much recourse (as opposed to a promissory estoppel claim)<p>The other concepts in play were common sense things, like the company had to made you a reasonable offer, you took reasonable actions based on that promise, and the company knew you were taking those actions. And finally, the “penalty” is often only the documented losses you really incurred which can seem tiny in comparison to the situation and intangible losses. I suspect many of these cases are settled before going to court.<p>IANAL and YMMV</p>"},{"id":"6cd9c74130e26920","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by manishmshiva in \"What Is Cybersecurity Forensics?

Introduction of namespaces is an improvement but it does not change the fact that everything is in global scope. The best practice for imports is to not include them outside of execution context, but it also makes it very hard to reason about what is actually being used by the file + you try to think about not loading files unnecessarily so it's not uncommon to add the import statement in the same file multiple times before using something and there are no type hints that say whether the include was imported or not. Which is more or less a consquence of the environment not having a proper runtime and everything being re-initialized with every request (in a runtime context, all files that would ever by used would be included, because they would be used eventually). I genuinely wonder how it came to be that a language developed specifically to serve web requests is not a loop, you would think that a runtime would be especially useful for handling requests and Facebook learned it the hard way, heck CLI input -> output programs are probably the only type of program where it would not be a limitation.</p>"},{"id":"2af8335a3458edcc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by narism in \"Teen’s death after eating a single chip highlights risks of ultra-spicy foods\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:19:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:19:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":572,"y":-52,"wires":[["6a04b3ef5b4f4cfd"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443825\n<hr>\n<p>The source/other articles [1][2][3] mention this particular chip has sent multiple other students to the hospital before.

GitHub uses ruby on rails but we know it from the developer team, not from what the server tells us. How many websites communicate about their backend infrastructure?<p>I don't doubt Wordpress powers many websites out there. But I'm tired of these figures which don't mean anything to me. Especially that if you look for all job ads, PHP isn't so big (except in some PHP-centric countries like France).<p>You can't just make up numbers. If you give me statistics, give me the methodology you used and all the details. Otherwise I suggest we all start to say Haskell powers 87% of the web. After all, if you can invent what suits you, I can do the same.</p>"},{"id":"9f9ebe92dbf14574","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by Uptrenda in \"Aardvark'd: The Fog Creek documentary, 18 years later\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:26:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:26:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":360.88691931262883,"y":949.9549240767174,"wires":[["786ff371bcb6f2fa"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443851\n<hr>\n<p>Maybe this is a dumb question: but what happened to the software they built?

LLMs can mean a bunch of different things, people call models the size of BERT LLMs sometimes. So let's talk specifically about in-context learning (ICL) with either zero or a few examples. So we'll say LLM ICL, and contrast that with techniques where you annotate enough data to train with, which might only be something like 10-40 hours of annotation. The something you do with that data is probably training a task-specific classification model initialised with weights from a language modelling objective. This is sometimes called \"fine-tuning\", but fine-tuning can also mean taking an LLM and adapting its ICL. So we'll just call it \"training\", and the fact you use transfer learning like BERT or even word vectors is just tactics.<p>Okay. So, here's something that might surprise you: ICL actually sucks at most predictive tasks currently. Let's take NER. Performance on NER on some datasets is _below 2003_. Here's some recent discussion: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mayhewsw/status/1700139745769046409\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/mayhewsw/status/1700139745769046409</a><p>The discussion focusses on how bad the CoNLL 2003 dataset is, and indeed it's a crap dataset. But experiments have also been done on other datasets, e.g. check out the comparison of ICL and training in this paper from Microsoft: <a href=\"https://universal-ner.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://universal-ner.github.io/</a> . When GPT4 is used this one paper reports it slightly better on some tasks: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092</a> . Frustratingly they don't do enough GPT4 experiments. This other paper also does a huge number of experiments, but not with GPT4: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092</a><p>The findings across the literature are really clear. ICL is generally much worse than training a model in accuracy, and you generally don't need much training data to get there.<p>For tasks like text classification, ICL sometimes does okay. But you need to pick the problem characteristics carefully. Most text classification tasks people actually want to do have something like 20 labels, the texts are kind of long, and the labels don't capture the category especially well. Applying ICL to such tasks is very non-trivial. Your prompt balloons up if you have lots of classes to predict between, and providing the examples is hard if your texts are even a few hundred words.<p>Let's say you want to do something <i>ultra</i> simple: classify articles into categories for some news site or blog. This is the type of problem text classifiers have been eating for breakfast for 20 years. This is not a difficult problem -- a unigram bag of words does fine, and the method of estimating the weights can be almost anything, like just averaged perceptron will be totally okay.<p>But how will an LLM be able to do this? Probably your topic categories include several different types of article under it. If you know what those types of article are you can separate them out and make sure they're represented in the prompt. But now we're back at needing a tonne of domain knowledge about your problem -- that's like having to write custom features to make your model work. We all switched to deep learning so we wouldn't have to do that.<p>LLMs build a much more sophisticated representation of the meaning of the data to classify. But then you give them very few examples of the <i>problem</i>. So they can only build a shallow function from this deep representation. If you have lots of examples, you can learn a complex function from shallower features. For a great many classification tasks, this is better. The rest of your system usually needs the classification module to have some sort of consistent behaviours anyway. To do that, you basically have to make an annotation manual, and then you want to annotate evaluation documents. Once you're there the effort to make training data and train a model is minimal.<p>The other elephant in the room is the expense of the LLM solutions. The papers are missing results on GPT4 not because they're lazy, but because it's so expensive to use GPT4 as a classification solution that they want to get the rest of their results out the door.<p>The world cannot migrate all its current NLP models for text classification and NER to ICL. There are nowhere near enough GPUs in the world for that to happen. And I don't know about you, but I expect the number of text classification and NER models to <i>grow</i>, not shrink. So, the idea that we'll stop training small models for these tasks is just implausible. The OpenAI models that support batching are almost viable for prediction, but models like GPT4 don't support it (perhaps due to the mixture of experts?), so it's super slow.<p>The other thing is, many aspects of language that are useful as annotations are consistent linguistic features. The English language codes for proper names and numeric entities. They behave differently in the grammar. So some sort of named entity annotation can be done once, and then the model trained and reused. This is what spaCy does. We do this for a variety of other useful annotations across languages. We actually need to do much more: we need to collect new annotations for these models to keep them up to date, and we need to do this for more tasks, such as semantic role labelling. But it's definitely a good way to reuse work. We can do this annotation once, train the models, and users can reuse the models.<p>The strength of ICL is that you can get started very easily, without doing the work of annotation and training. There's lots of research on making ICL few-shot learning less bad on arbitrary text classification, NER and other tasks. We're working hard to take these results from the literature and build best-practice prompts and parsers you can use as a drop-in annotation module in spaCy: <a href=\"https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm\">https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm</a> . Our annotation tool Prodigy also supports initializing the annotations from an LLM, and just correcting the output: <a href=\"https://prodigy.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://prodigy.ai</a> . The idea is to let you start with an LLM, and then transition to a model you train yourself, which can be run much faster.</p>"},{"id":"d38238c58b04ee2f","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by dash2 in \"The PGP Problem (2019)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2586,"y":-1284,"wires":[["5d67fb7e0ef8c8b5"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443920\n<hr>\n<p>This seems like part of a more general phenomenon: shonky or outdated 2000s open source software getting in the way of progress.</p>"},{"id":"2cd231df68f6a5f4","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by IdiranVibe in \"Safety inspector fired for finding 'too many defects'\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4724,"y":-476,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443919\n<hr>\n<p>> at most city speeds<p>This is exactly it!

This creates two problems:<p>- once you create such self-references you can no longer move this struct. But moving a struct is safe, so you need some unsafe code that \"promises\" you this won't happen. `Pin` is a witness of such promise.<p>- in the memory model having an `&mut` reference to this struct means that it is the only way to access it. But this is no longer true for self referential structs, since there are other ways to access its contents, namely the fields corresponding to those local variables that reference other local variables.

a customer email chain where they try to describe what is happening, sometimes with pictures, requires level 4 understanding.<p>You often end up with multiple documents (several emails, pictures,

I'll cede the argument about the e-commerce platforms and CRMs, but I'm just not convinced that PHP is where a budding developer should be focusing their efforts. You enter the business/corporate world and there are tons of applications out there running the world, not just websites. Those applications are predominantly written in languages like .NET, Java, JS/ECMAScript, Python, Rust, and Go. Also, among the managed languages like .NET/Java/JS the knowledge is quite transferrable and sometimes almost identically named.<p>I'm not trying to bash PHP as a language, but every time I see this argument it's the same. Evangelizing PHP also seems to come with a requirement to mention Wordpress, Wikipedia, and Facebook. I'm sure there's money to be made in PHP, and I'm sure it's a great language for the internet. But learning .NET or Java is likely to have a much larger window of opportunity. Also, if you have a specific industry you want to work in you should be looking at the language predominately sought after in that industry.<p>I think this is why a lot of developers bash PHP, it's not that it's a non-valid choice. It's that it has limited applicability.

The reason why it happens are complex, but it boils down to energy. All such diseases have a common trait: they cause disruption of ATP production at the cellular level, affecting mitochondria. Then comes a cascading effect: without sufficient levels of energy, cells start to degrade. At early stages, it mostly affects high-energy cells like those in the brain and the rest of nervous system. Then comes the liver and muscles (including heart). At the end stage, the effect may cause a multiorgan failure and even death.<p>A reason why diets affect this situation so much is two-fold. First, a diet affects microbiota, causing stagnation and proliferation of selected species. Second, the diet affects cells and its organelles, especially mitochondria. For example, some acquired mitochondrial damages can be reversed by a sufficient supply of vitamins and minerals in combination with the right balance of carbohydrates and fats in the diet.<p>It is worth to remember that one has to eliminate the initial disruption factor that caused the problem in the first place.

Ruby is still not \"fast\" (but I haven't tested it with yjit yet). I put up with it because I know I can make it significantly faster later.<p>As it turns out for a whole lot of things Ruby is slow for people because one of the nice things about programming in Ruby a lot of the time is expressing the problem the more readable way first rather than paying attention to performance. When people are aware, it makes it easy to iterate fast and fix performance later. The problem is a lot of the time that leads to pathological cases of people not thinking this through at all.<p>You'll notice most of his performance increase came from writing better Ruby. Clearly the original Graphql parser was nowhere near optimal. It's worth keeping in mind that writing a C extension ought to be a last resort after making the Ruby as fast as you can first, because often that means you don't need to.<p>E.g. another of Aaron's recent articles is about speeding up a parser by cutting down on object creation, and one specific example he gave was to return just the token type from the lexer instead of [token_type, token_value]. The latter forced creation of an Array object to hold each token and a string object for the token value (though for fixed tokens you could avoid that by returning the same frozen string literal), and for a whole lot of tokens the parser had no interest in the token string (e.g. if you see :lparen, or :rparen, getting \"(\" and \")\" is entirely uninteresting). When people run into slow Ruby code like that it's tempting to resort to C right away, rather than understand <i>why</i> their Ruby is slow.<p>I love that yjit makes it <i>easier</i> to get to a point where you don't need to reach for C, though.</p>"},{"id":"96e701f268efb8e1","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by xattt in \"The Carrington Event of 1859 and the Potential for a “Miyake Event”\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-5352,"y":612,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444024\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"2ea88f4f4f240ef9","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"X challenges California’s new transparency law as unconstitutional\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3063,"y":2496,"wires":[["54d4ad4c6871984b"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444023\n<hr>\n<p>- <i>\"Section 230 immunizes the supposed expressive content of X's editorial policy\"</i><p>The First Amendment protects the expressive content of X's editorial policy.<p>- <i>\"X shouldn't have as free rein to run that program in secret according to unknown whims.\"</i><p>The First Amendment protects secretive editorial policies run according to editors' whims.</p>"},{"id":"d33a61857caac4e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by matthewmorgan in \"Ask HN: Good Books on Universal Basic Income?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":712,"y":-316,"wires":[["c3efbf98faced87a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444022\n<hr>\n<p>Not a book but look up Milton Friedman's remarks on negative income tax.

It was back compatible with php 5.x including bugs and sometime poorly designed interface and used WordPress, MediaWiki testing suite to ensure they caught any regressions. The team behind HHVM probably saved Facebook from crippling capex / operating costs and at Wikimedia we literally halved the CPU load when we switched. At the time Facebook and Wikimedia ran PHP 5.3 or 5.4 and both had performance issues  or at least concern with the huge amount of CPU required for their workload.<p>HHVM had some optional language feature on top of PHP such as typing and some helpful additional functions, that became the Hack language which is essentially a fork of the PHP language.<p>All the work on HHMV and the nice performances from it eventually challenged PHP which with PHP v7 came with a similar VM / Jit system. At that point, the performance benefices of running HHVM vs php v7 where not justifying the extra complexity (notably lack of garbage collector by choice, or complexity in deploying the sqlite bytecode holind the code to be executed). Wikimedia then moved back to PHP.</p>"},{"id":"ff82d9f36db6acd4","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by nabla9 in \"Why not matrix?

Why shouldn't that work?\nTo be able to again send SMS text messages to someone you used to talk with is to disable iMessage of course, then sign out of Facetime (who could imagine that as a necessary step?), sign out of iCloud, reboot the iPhone, and wait some minutes to hours to days until you are \"deregistered\" from iMessage.

But their methodology to me seems quite flawed:<p>1. They use “ChatGPT” and never mention if it’s 3.5 or 4 (unless I missed it—don’t think so) so I suspect 3.5.<p>2. They ask ChatGPT to evaluate the truthfulness of new headlines outside its training data cutoff, don’t show it the source of the headline (e.g. a reputable news outlet or not), and don’t allow it to to use an internet search to determine if the news is corroborated.<p>So their claim that it’s “ineffective” seems like a pretty big overreach. At best you might say “AI fact-checking by relatively weak models not given all available information and asked to evaluate headlines outside their training data cutoff” are ineffective. Duh!<p>Clearly, if you were to design a good AI fact-checker, you wouldn’t design it like this.

I was in the hobbyist community as a younger teen since the beginning of pi till 2016-17. When I stopped at that time ESP8266 had just so much potential as the cheap microcontroller with wifi and RPi Zero W as the cheap microcontroller with wifi as well. The development environment had improved so much over the years and things seemed great. The alternative pi clones also were building their own identity and figuring out their software.\nOver the years I felt guilty for not experimenting given that Rpi4 had 8 gigs of ram! and surely the competition would be better. I bought a bunch of Zeros, ESPs and 4s when I couldn't find other alternatives much but surely that was because I was out of the community and didn't know what to buy. And surely there would have been ESP alternative in all these years with lower power alternatives now that IOT is going to be a bigger thing finally.\nAlas, last year I came back to the hobbyist scene finally! Excited! And it was all a major disappointment. All my favourite hobbyist stores in my country had shut down or increased prices for basically everything by a huge margin. It all seemed more polished but so much more void of the vibrancy of the earlier scene. All the experimental boards sort of failing. And I can't even buy the boards anymore. Thankfully I could retrieve all the boards I had bought in past so didn't have to chase boards in flash sales as everyone else I knew had to. \nBut it's so sad.</p>"},{"id":"959ac95b7f444910","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by jerrygenser in \"Advanced NLP with SpaCy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:12:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:12:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1050,"y":-412,"wires":[["c1d0f9b2839949a9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444422\n<hr>\n<p>LLM are not somewhat fast when measured against CPU models in spacy that are specialized for a task.

There are multiple genuinely free e-file providers and most people could easily file their taxes themselves on paper.<p>That said, while I agree the IRS situation can be dramatically improved - move the Free Fillable Forms program to the irs.gov domain instead of just linking to it, for starters, or just buy out one of the extant free programs and incorporate it - takes like this miss a lot of important factors.<p>1. US taxpayers are filing federal <i>and state</i> taxes. The state tax revenue agencies are completely independent of the IRS. While free federal filing would be nice, you've only solved no-more-than 50% of my problem. (Many people have to file in multiple states.)<p>2. This is relatively well known, but the US tax code is generally more complicated than many other countries. This isn't so much of a problem except that US taxpayers are obsessed with making sure the government doesn't get one over on them. They are always on the lookout for deductions and credits, frequently that they <i>may</i> not even be actually eligible for. I personally know a lot of people who have illegitimately claimed commuting mileage on their taxes, for example. So the complexity is a <i>desired feature</i>, not something you can just remove without consequence.<p>3. Because of the US federal system and US privacy rights, most countries collect much more information about their citizens than the US federal government. The IRS and the US federal government does not even know where you live until you tell it. They don't know what, if any, children you actually have living with you - which at $2000 tax <i>credit</i> per kid, is extremely important information when calculating your tax bill.<p>4. This is an issue that mostly affects educated upper-middle class people, not lower income people. I have struggled to convince most lower income people to use free! tax prep software at <i>all</i>. Most of them are paying companies and individuals to do their taxes, convinced that some guy with an office has the power to arm-wrestle the IRS and get them more back on their tax refund than anyone else via secret loopholes that don't exist on the 1040EZ. (They are wrong, except to the degree the less circumspect filers definitely commit lots of tax fraud.) You will never, ever convince these people to use the IRS website to file their taxes - that's walking into the enemy camp, in their minds. On top of this, they are convinced that making a tiny mistake on their taxes will result in severe fines and penalties and possibly imprisonment, despite the fact the IRS generally is very amenable to working with you.

In this repo, I was able to emulate NES ROMs in Ghidra to test its 6502 specification, which resulted in finding and fixing some bugs.<p>Context: Ghidra is used for reverse engineering binary executables, complementing the usual disassembly view with function decompilation. Each supported architecture has a SLEIGH specification, which provides semantics for parsing and emulating instructions, not unlike the dispatch handlers you would find in interpreters written for console emulators.<p>Emulator devs have long had extensive test ROMs for popular consoles, but Ghidra only provides CPU emulation, so it can't run them without additional setup. What I did here is bridge the gap: by modifying a console emulator to instead delegate CPU execution to Ghidra, we can now use these same ROMs to validate Ghidra processor modules.<p>Previously [1], I went with a trace log diffing approach, where any hardware specific behaviour that affected CPU execution was also encoded in trace logs. However, it required writing hardware specific logic, and is still not complete. With the delegation approach, most of this effort is avoided, since it's easier to hook and delegate memory accesses.<p>I plan on continuing research in this space and generalizing my approaches, since it shows potencial for complementing existing test coverage provided by pcodetest. If a simple architecture like 6502 had a few bugs, who knows how many are in more complex architectures! I wasn't able to find similar attempts (outside of diffing and coverage analysis from trace logs), please let me know if I missed something, and any suggestions for improvements.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/nevesnunes/ghidra-tlcs900h#emulation\">https://github.com/nevesnunes/ghidra-tlcs900h#emulation</a></p>"},{"id":"e351cc52833ad807","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by tgv in \"Appeals Court Rules White House Overstepped First Amendment on Social Media\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:42:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:42:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1908,"y":492,"wires":[["cb046ba386db967e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444686\n<hr>\n<p>> how do we solve for the society-wide censorship problem<p>Or: how do we \"solve for\" the people-that-want-absolute-freedom-of-speech problem?

This applies regardless of what financial obligations they may have as a renter or homeowner and regardless of the situation of the rest of their family.<p>And if after their job ends they rush out of the country to meet the immigration deadline, any lingering ties to the US will make it harder for them to convince CBP to let them re-enter on visitor status, so the departure may in some circumstances be either temporarily or permanently one-way as well as rushed.<p>The severity of this disruption forces many H-1B workers to meekly put up with a lot more abuse and mistreatment at work than do US citizens, LPRs, and those lucky few categories of nonimmigrants whose work authorizations are not tied to their employment. Agreed, it’s not slavery, but it’s not full freedom either.<p>A more humane approach would be what Canada does: holders of Canadian employer-specific work permits who quit or lose their job are nevertheless legally allowed to remain in Canada until the date their current work permit expires. They can rely on that predictability when signing leases, planning their children’s education, and other matters. And it often gives them far more time than the tight US deadline to find a new employer to sponsor a subsequent work permit.</p>"},{"id":"d37025d6a4b3f435","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by bombcar in \"As wildfires burn across the world, what is the role of Australia's eucalyptus?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1120,"y":76,"wires":[["38d0207b7fa429ad"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444836\n<hr>\n<p>It was thought it might be - but it turned out not to work as such, too twisty.</p>"},{"id":"b2db6d744941a657","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"Appeals Court Rules White House Overstepped First Amendment on Social Media\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1908,"y":652,"wires":[["cb046ba386db967e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444835\n<hr>\n<p>pdf<p><a href=\"https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-30445-CV0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-30445-CV0.pd...</a></p>"},{"id":"47f4a12d9650a18c","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by zainhoda in \"Show HN: Vanna AI – Open-sourced text-to-SQL in Python\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2012,"y":260,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444833\n<hr>\n<p>It probably could but it would require adjusting the prompt.

I can't work out who did think this was a good idea.\"</i><p>Well, I'd very definitely agree with that comment. I have firsthand experience of eucalyptus trees and bushfires and I find it truly perplexing why people in other countries would want to put their lives and property at risk by planting this dangerous invasive species that often grows faster and more robustly there than it does in Australia.<p>I grew up in a very fire-prone part of Australia in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales west of Sydney and I've lived through some of the most devastating fires. At the end I've posted a link to a YouTube video of a fire I was caught up in as a kid. It was many decades ago but I still have vivid memories of the event. It's impossible to forget witnessing over a hundred homes and businesses burn down as the fire raged through the township.<p>Unless one's been caught up in a raging busfire it's almost impossible to visualize what it's really like, especially one involving eucalyptus trees, the roaring noise is almost deafening and suddenly trees just explode when the eucalypt oil ignites. It can be very frightening.<p>Luckily, my parents' home wasn't in the path of the fire it being several kilometers away but I saw the aftermath and I helped out with bringing bedding and provisions to the poor souls who'd lost their homes and possessions—list everything. It was a truly pitiful sight to see so many people crammed into the town hall floor space of the next town with hardly a footstep between them.<p>The video is quite long, about 30 min, and of course is a revisited historical video so the camera footage isn't a vivid as one expects nowadays. Nevertheless, it depicts the human loss very well indeed. When I first saw the video some years back I could feel myself reliving the event, it was quite uncanny. Incidentally, in the video one gets a quick glimpse of that town hall where the victims were temporarily rehoused.<p>From images of recent fires across the globe that have involved eucalyptus trees, it seems to me we ought to be severely limiting these foreign plantings. I recall years ago, when I first went to California and saw that the eucalyptus trees grew better there that in many parts of Australia I was horrified. From my experience it was clear to me what was going to happen there.<p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYOVnmkP0c\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYOVnmkP0c</a></p>"},{"id":"a164fba8a0ba4e87","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by fortran77 in \"U.S. Government Is Monitoring All Global Entry Members Daily\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 13:35:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 13:35:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3275.5174951186264,"y":1461.2158751105262,"wires":[["9341078fdee276d9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445232\n<hr>\n<p>Well, it's a little more than that.

This means you will be pliable in many ways you would otherwise not be. You can be denied promotions, you can be given shitty/grunt work, you can be given borderline unethical work, you can be asked to fire other people in unsympathetic ways, you can be asked to work weekends and nights without any overtime pay, you can be asked to travel very long distances for work in economy class and so on and you shall not complain.<p>You can only suffer silently until you get another job.

Vaccines were first said to “prevent”[1], and then they moved the wording to being “less likely to spread”[2]. Social distancing only prolonged the pandemic and put more at risk, as the only way to reasonably mitigate a non-deadly and contagious disease for which we have no real vaccine against is to create herd immunity, just like we do with the flu every single year. Yet the government used social media to continue to spread the misinformation that you crave, creating propaganda and draconian rules in order to worsen the long-term impacts.<p>[0] - <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/surgeon-general-coronavirus-masks-risk-trnd/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/surgeon-general-corona...</a><p>[1] - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfL2sespLnY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfL2sespLnY</a><p>[2] - <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/covid-19-vaccination-spread/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/covid-19-vaccination-...</a></p>"},{"id":"c9ea8ce49b9870a","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by metaltyphoon in \"Bun v1.0.0\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:00:16 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:00:16 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1244,"y":-3692,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445516\n<hr>\n<p>>what do you base this ad hominem on?<p>Look at OP's original post.

That’s 15m2.<p>At 4.5 hours of sunlight on average summer day, if the parking lot was covered with solar panel, it would generate 4.5MW of energy.<p>Suppose hypothetically we could have an an artificial tree like technology that could convert solar to gasoline like hydrocarbon, like trees capture solar + CO2 + H20 into glucose + O2.<p>That artificial tree solar panel would generate equivalent of 20 gallons of gasoline per month.<p>Avg car consumes about 40 gallons a month. So 2 parking lots would generate enough energy for 1 car.<p>An area the size of New Zealand / Italy / UK (roughly 300km2) if covered with solar can meet energy needs of the entire planet.<p>IMO the holy grail of solar will be when we crack artificial tree like technology if we can crack solar -> dense hydrocarbon store and make it cheap.<p>Trees/plants are both materials and fuel. The best form of carbon capture I know of. Wood is one of the most renewable construction materials.<p>So if one could make an artificial tree that captured CO2 + solar and turned it into hydrocarbon fuel + high strength/light weight carbon-fibre-like wood, that would be the epic holy grail. Abundant high density green fuels + strong light weight building materials.<p>Fundamentally it is possible. I just don’t know how.<p>In the universe of all possible DNA, I think there exists a configuration of DNA that will yield a tree like that.<p>-<p>I may get downvoted for dreaming. However from laws of physics and biochemistry artificial trees should be possible.</p>"},{"id":"4e0be614516862a0","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by Supermancho in \"An Internet of PHP\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:30:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:30:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-872,"y":-3052,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445873\n<hr>\n<p>This move toward a more rigid and static typing pushed me to move to Java (which also pays more).

though I had my fair share of scripting and I can produce \"some code\" if necessary).<p>Few months ago I had a problem of booking a service that could have weeks/months of wait, and ended up crafting a 10-15 lines script in Powershell that monitored the underlying API used by that service for the specific thing I needed every few min and notify me via ntfy.sh on my phone.<p>When I shared this with colleagues they joked with me suggesting to sell this as a service. I briefly thought about it but discarded the option as I don't believe this would be really remunerative considering this is specific for the country I am living which is quite small (also it will be highly dependent of that specific web application and its API). \nStill, I believe it would be a nice thing to try to build a simple app (probably web rather than mobile) and share it with the local users. \nA dev would probably take a weekend to do the bulk of it, but I am not a dev :) and unfortunately family and work take enough time.<p>The way I see it would be something like:<p>- users will be able to simply register/login (or at least I need a way to map their choice to their notification \"address\" and avoid they spam others / allow them to modify/cancel a monitor - could be using some social login or magic links or classic user with mail.. )<p>- they will be able to select what they need to monitor (they type some word / site fetches options based on a list that is built by querying that remote site API and they select), specify few options (checkboxes or similar)<p>- a background process will run and check the availability based on the list of the users requests, see if anything has changed and notified the appropriate users when a slot is freed up (I used ntfy.sh for myself but it's probably not ideal for users to expect them to install the app so maybe I will have to use email or similar methods)<p>As Powershell is one of the thing that I know quite, I had thought about using Azure Functions (which I never used) as it can run Powershell, but I am open to other options as long as it doesn't mean becoming a full stack dev..<p>I am often lurking on HN and reading about automation tools, no code products, languages and such. \nMany nocode tools that I have seen discussed in HN are for internal apps/dashboards (budibase etc.) and bubble.io and similar might be expensive for running a free application (I would need to review what they offer and their tiers). Would products like n8n.io help or they would be useful only for the backend/integration part but not for building a user facing interface?\nWhat would you suggest to use to develop such app?<p>thanks</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445912\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445912</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5ce7c91fd03ac50f","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Show HN: It's Like HN, but for Science","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1660,"y":-1960,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://synthical.com/feed/simple\">https://synthical.com/feed/simple</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445905\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445905</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"ee301b8eb8df9161","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1368,"y":-3052,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445903\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445903</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"385ea61e8529ae57","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Brainfuck Stark Tutorial","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1252,"y":-4116,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://neptune.cash/learn/brainfuck-tutorial/\">https://neptune.cash/learn/brainfuck-tutorial/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445900\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445900</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"d6bc245a97f01013","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Marketing Bought an API","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:32:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:32:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1500,"y":-4116,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://bitdream.dev/posts/that-time-marketing-bought-an-api/\">https://bitdream.dev/posts/that-time-marketing-bought-an-api/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445894\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445894</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"3a84faefa7c2e32e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by k_ in \"Morocco earthquake kills more than 1,000\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:49:36 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:49:36 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2472.445439741563,"y":3312.600025755185,"wires":[["cb4b06cdba31b126"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446053\n<hr>\n<p>That his research subject has not given \"proper\" scientific results yet (or ever) doesn't make him a fraud.

It opened up whole new avenues of music appreciation for me.<p>Prior to reading it, I had never truly considered things like how the space in which music was consumed needed to be tailored to the type of music that would be played in that venue.  For example, the acoustic precision of an opera house or cathedral would be wasted on The Ramones or Black Flag, just as the boxy space of a place like CBGB would be totally wrong for a chamber orchestra.  It makes sense in retrospect, of course, but as a non-musician I had never considered it before.<p>Now I'm reading Ted Gioia's \"Music: A Subversive History\".

Properly implemented, this sort of tax would totally wipe out any returns from buy-and-hold investment in real estate, essentially turning it into a depreciating asset. Holders of unproductive/underproductive real estate would be forced to sell to developers or continue to lose money.<p>LVT is also nice because it cannot be passed on to tenants in the form of rent increases. Raising rent causes the value of the land to go up with it, leading to higher taxes which claw back all of the gains from the rental increase. If the landlord chooses to continue raising rent to stay ahead of the taxes, this upward spiral will price the property right out of the rental market, leading to high taxes and vacancy, causing the landlord to lose money.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax</a></p>"},{"id":"b5ad7c4b4c71780","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by dzaima in \"What happens when you shift a register by more than the register size?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 15:40:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 15:40:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2055.0171353069795,"y":1841.943646291742,"wires":[["b0ecc07e2e352925"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446651\n<hr>\n<p>Note that this is only for the direct shift instructions.

And even if they did, showing citizens of X things which the people of X do not agree is correct is definitely not serving your users.</p>"},{"id":"a6b48ba38e25b281","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by Zetice in \"Google, Meta, Amazon hiring low-paid H1B workers after US layoffs\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 15:55:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 15:55:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3053,"y":3584,"wires":[["c36dfc4fb2983706"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446802\n<hr>\n<p>No, it's meant to determine which people have agreed to the social contract.

Indeed, even personal property boundaries are often not as certain as you'd like. My property has a large triangle of land which is disputed with my neighbor, for example, because of differences in surveys at different times.<p>At the level of political science, most people understand international relations to be, more or less, a sort of state of anarchy, where boundaries are nothing but a bare reflection of <i>power</i>. From this point of view, most calls for \"agreement\" about a disputed boundary are nothing more than demands by one party for the other to accede to their claim of what they own. I personally believe that this kind of bickering by nation states is pretty far beneath the dignity of the label of \"real\" and all human beings would be better off if we appreciated that fact.</p>"},{"id":"32fce385cf5b77f9","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by Zetice in \"Public restrooms are hard to find in America.

The new price per kilowatt hour will be smaller than the existing rates.</p>"},{"id":"6a4bf307ec4f7947","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by Zetice in \"Google, Meta, Amazon hiring low-paid H1B workers after US layoffs\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:21:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:21:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3053,"y":3840,"wires":[["c36dfc4fb2983706"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447079\n<hr>\n<p>I’m not predicting anything.</p>"},{"id":"41182621acd5abb8","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by mattkenefick in \"Bun v1.0.0\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:21:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:21:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2636,"y":-3644,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447078\n<hr>\n<p>Get a new machine</p>"},{"id":"f58b14208f358d4b","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by ahoka in \"Every type of plastic used by Lego (2022)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:21:02 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:21:02 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1128,"y":-2300,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447077\n<hr>\n<p>This is literally the plot of the LEGO movie.</p>"},{"id":"ccbee8b1467484ee","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by hutzlibu in \"Newly discovered comet Nishimura could be visible to naked eye this weekend\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:20:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:20:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4564,"y":2068,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447075\n<hr>\n<p>Thatbis of course true, but the climate crisis is way more abstract than a concrete hit that is coming at a fixed date. \nSo yes, more and more people acknowledge now, that the weather seems to get more extreme, but that's about it.\nBoiling frog effect.</p>"},{"id":"42daf62534b50fd3","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by pjc50 in \"Michael Taylor on the Development of the M1 Garand and Its Implications\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:20:35 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:20:35 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4624,"y":1316,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447073\n<hr>\n<p>Firearms regulation has a real \"gun of Theseus\" problem: if you have multiple parts combined into an illegal weapon, which one of those is the illegal part?</p>"},{"id":"99f508bac9a9849c","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by mkagenius in \"Bare-Metal Kubernetes, Part I: Talos on Hetzner\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:20:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:20:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3379.9262329834282,"y":2331.0875356337156,"wires":[["f4a942e619c4d740"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447072\n<hr>\n<p>From this, if people get the idea that they should get a Bare Metal on Hetzner and try.

McKinsey begs to differ, sparking a fiery debate. But both sides might be missing a crucial detail: the distinction between manual and knowledge work. By clearly delineating between these two, we can define productivity in software development. Let's dive deeper!<p>When we focus on tech roles, particularly software developers, the distinction becomes more pronounced. As Drucker aptly noted, many knowledge workers, which he termed \"technologists\", straddle both realms: manual and cognitive. He cites professions such as surgeons and dentists as examples. But where does this leave software developers?<p>Both manual and knowledge work yield outputs, outcomes, and impacts. The stark difference lies in the input. While manual work's primary input is muscle effort, software development thrives on cognitive effort. This becomes evident when we realize that in manual tasks, much of the necessary knowledge is already embedded in the machines and procedures. In contrast, software development demands continuous knowledge acquisition and application, necessitating a deeper level of problem-solving and innovation.<p>Software development isn't just about typing or producing lines of code; it's deeply rooted in the acquisition and application of knowledge. This is particularly true for the knowledge developers initially lacked—the information they needed to procure to fulfill their tasks.<p>This notion becomes palpable in activities such as problem-solving sessions to decipher both the 'what' and 'how' of building a software system, meetings focused on filling knowledge gaps, and code reviews that solicit insights beyond the visible code.<p>If we insist on evaluating software developers by the metrics of manual labor, we're not just using the wrong yardstick—we're playing an entirely different game. Understanding this distinction is crucial, especially for leaders aiming to harness the full potential of their software development teams.<p>#SoftwareProductivity #KnowledgeVsManual #McKinsey</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447022\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447022</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"baec1dd98714fe63","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Writing a Pathtracer in Lua, Week 5: LuaJIT and BVH","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:11:33 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:11:33 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":212,"y":-3204,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.42yeah.is/rendering/2023/09/07/luapt-5.html\">https://blog.42yeah.is/rendering/2023/09/07/luapt-5.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446990\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446990</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"4c1bdd4e42614060","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by landemva in \"Snoop unto them as they snoop unto you\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:26:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:26:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":958,"y":2852,"wires":[["7921fe766f3209fc"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447136\n<hr>\n<p>Wow, noise measurements seem prone to manipulation.

Cost of housing, both to buy and to rent, has scaled greatly out of pace with Canadian salaries. Our PM and his cabinet recently went on a retreat with the intention of creating an action plan on how to get us pointed in the right direction. They came back empty handed. [1]<p>Truthfully I don't think this is an issue the federal government is in a position to solve any time soon. The long and short is that our population has grown faster than our supply of housing, COVID being an unfortunately timed disruption which further strained that supply. Nothing was built for almost a year, but the population continued to grow.<p>If I had a singular policy suggestion, after having talked to some friends in the industry, it would be to pump federal money into expediting site plan approvals and environmental assessments done at a county or municipal level. Some of these offices have tiny rosters who end up being the bottlenecks for enormous projects which otherwise would be breaking ground. Environmental assessments are notoriously time-consuming and particular in Canada, something we're largely very proud of. That said, I believe if there were ever a time for Canadians to be okay with cutting corners if it meant getting more of us into homes, I think it would be now. From my understanding, there are many housing projects in Ontario for which construction could begin next week, if not for the Sisyphean approval processes.<p>Here's an example of a site plan approval process for a town in Ontario[2] - just imagine all the points in which that chain of communication can get gummed up and projects can sit idle. We're used to steps like this taking a couple weeks in tech, but in the land development industry things move s l o w.<p>Canadians often take pride in our ability to do things the way they're meant to be done and to follow the rules as presented, even when they might not make sense in the moment. I think occasionally our love of process can be our downfall.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://archive.ph/CZE3y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://archive.ph/CZE3y</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.middlesexcentre.on.ca/sites/default/files/2021-07/Middlesex%20Centre%20Planning%20Guides%20-%20Site%20Plan%20Approval.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.middlesexcentre.on.ca/sites/default/files/2021-0...</a></p>"},{"id":"cb73c474c2babe5","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by dahfizz in \"CRISPR used to 'reprogram' cancer cells into healthy muscle in the lab\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:44:25 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:44:25 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1082,"y":220,"wires":[["399ddfb3a1ce6079"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447331\n<hr>\n<p>Seems like way more hassle than just taking steroids</p>"},{"id":"8a508006a0292f3e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by pjc50 in \"Is there enough oxygen for a growing population?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:44:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 16:44:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2098,"y":3853,"wires":[["ec29e05cab694cd7"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447330\n<hr>\n<p>Yes.

It’s sort of like Mobbin for web-based product onboarding.<p>We build a lot of product onboarding at our startup Frigade, and over the last year we’ve put together an internal library of hundreds of product onboarding examples that we refer to all the time with customers. It helps them find and copy patterns that work at other companies so they don’t need to create net new experiences or A/B test their way into the best performing pattern from scratch.<p>Given it's been so useful to us, we decided to open it up to the world. We bought productonboarding.com and have started adding examples from our collection and made them browsable and sortable. We’re planning to add new examples weekly.<p>Hope this is helpful to any of you who are currently thinking through building new onboarding experiences. Would love any ideas and feedback.

For example, the first few bars when the melody enters in Moonlight sonata: I wasn't sure if I keep the fidelity of the dotted-eighth rhythms verses the triple eighths, or if I turn it into essential a sextuplet.\n- I found that some quicker figures, such as the opening of Mozart's \"Alla turca\" are best achieved by using the actual fingering I would use in the original.

The \"false advertising\" component of culturally mandated tipping is a competitive advantage in the absence of something to counteract it.<p>It's like saying companies should just avoid hidden fees because customers don't prefer them.

Because most people are not no-tip assholes.<p>So in order to to make C work you need customers to make B unsustainable.

Powerpoint is so commonplace now that we cannot even conceive of different ways of presenting information to groups.  If you cannot figure out how to express an idea in the medium of Powerpoint or slideware in general, then that idea is difficult to express nowadays.  That limits the kind of information you can share, especially complex information that is not so easily conveyed in bullet points or in sparse infographics.  \"The medium is the message\", in other words.<p>Maybe I'm old, but I remember going over a lot of information in group settings without the use of Powerpoint.  Here's a few examples of alternatives:<p>- overhead projectors (common when I was in elementary school)<p>- slide projectors<p>- lectures and speeches<p>- live demonstrations<p>- field and laboratory work (can be very hands-on learning)<p>- panel discussions and debates<p>- group discussions (after everyone reads a book or report)<p>- displaying a written report on a screen rather than distinct slides (I do this myself sometimes)<p>Some of these aren't going to work that well if you need to convey Q3 sales figures, for example, but my point is that there are other options out there even though Powerpoint has flooded the arena.  Note that you can even combine these with Powerpoint or slideware and get the best of both worlds too for that matter.  I'm not against Powerpoint as much as I dislike how it is conventionally used.<p>(I must also note that many people, myself included, hate the \"slow crawl\" of having information revealed progressively.  It might work sparingly for dramatic effect but having been in so many meetings with bad speakers, it is far too easily abused and always makes me ask myself \"When will the speaker get to the point?\").</p>"},{"id":"a16051041bfa13bb","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by eggy in \"Learning Zig\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:30:57 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:30:57 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4076.398189560731,"y":682.5166626789619,"wires":[["ee7c7f9536e0f1da","a61f6d415ab8a2c2"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447844\n<hr>\n<p>For me, Zig is more of a better C plus.

I work on a variety of specialized NLP use-cases for clients and there are different strengths these approaches have. The big thing with LLMs is the ability to deploy something quickly if (a) if you can craft an appropriate prompt, (b) put up enough guardrails to stop surfacing hallucinated responses to users. For assistant or co-pilot kind of systems (b) is somewhat easy to deal with, since the user is expected to curate or edit the LLM's responses, hence their proliferation in such use-cases. Note though: if the LLM sounds authoritative enough it might bias the user to believing it is right - not a big problem when the user is relying on it for generating good prose, but this is a problem when presenting facts (esp.  based on a specialized knowledge base).<p>The downsides are (a) latency, (b) cost, and (c) the need for specialized training. In some applications, you require near real-time responses, and smaller models are still better here. The cost angle is a little tricky - it depends both on the volume of calls you want to make and if this cost translates into revenue for the possibly incremental benefit you derive from an LLM. As an example, lets say you have a chatbot that does NER/slot-filling using a spacy or stanza today, and lets also assume ChatGPT can do better - does the incremental accuracy, that comes at a cost since you're paying OpenAI - translate into incremental revenue (or profit)? I am not sure what the answer here is - its probably a NO right now, but there is a positive deferred benefit - as your chatbot solution becomes better in many small and large ways, it might sell better in the future. The specialized training part is when you can gather a use-case-specific dataset that can get a fairly good accuracy (comparable or greater than an LLM), esp. considering (a) and (b). Note that these concerns are largely true even for self-hosted LLMs like llama - just that the precise breakeven point changes.</p>"},{"id":"6435f12977497c4","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by grumpopotamus in \"Comparing 60 LLMs with a set of 20 prompts\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:30:41 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:30:41 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2125.517995073807,"y":4633.35266787126,"wires":[["82ca9492433473e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37447837\n<hr>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that most or all of these models are very sensitive to the exact prompt.

it generates replies that are exactly like mine. The concept's appeared in fiction numerous times (the talking paintings in Harry Potter that mimic the person painted, the clones in The Prestige), and I think with LLMs, there might actually be a possibility of us doing something like this!<p>I've just released a fork of the facebookresearch/llama-recipes which allows you to fine-tune a Llama model on your personal WhatsApp conversations. This adaptation can train the model (using QLoRA) to respond in a way that's eerily similar to your own texting style.<p>What I've figured out so far:<p>Quick Learning: The model quickly adapts to personal nuances, emoji usage, and phrases that you use. I've trained just 1 epoch on a P100 GPU using QLoRA and 4 bit quantization, and its already captured my mannerisms<p>Turing Tests: As an experiment, I asked my friends to ask me 3 questions, and responded with 2 candidate responses (one from me and one from llama). My friends then had to guess which candidate response was mine and which one was Llama's. Llama managed to fool 10% of my friends, but with more compute, I think it can do way better.<p>Here's the GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/Ads-cmu/WhatsApp-Llama/\">https://github.com/Ads-cmu/WhatsApp-Llama/</a><p>Would love to hear feedback, suggestions, and any cool experiences if you decide to give it a try!

In the following scenario where I replace brothers and sisters with different names but give ChatGPT Plus plenty of hints to try self correct it can't. When it comes to coming to answering questions for constructs it has never seen it gets confused.<p>-------------<p>User:<p>You have to answer a question about a family on a planet inhabited by aliens called Frobians, . Each Frobian can be one of two types Frobel or Frobo.\nA twerp is a Frobo, is also relationship notation that holds unidirectionally from a Frobel to a Frobo.\nA clep is a Frobel,  is also  is a relationship notation that holds unidirectionally from Frobo to a Frobel<p>In a family Master Foo, a Frobian, is of type Frobel. Master Foo has 3 twerps in their family. Each twerp in the family has 2 cleps. How many Frobels in total does Master Foo have?<p>-------------<p>Assistant: In this problem, we have Master Foo, who is a Frobel. Master Foo has 3 twerps, and each twerp is a Frobo. Each of these twerps has 2 cleps, and each clep is a Frobel.<p>Here's how to break it down:<p><pre><code>    Master Foo is a Frobel, so we start with 1 Frobel.\n    Master Foo has 3 twerps, which are Frobos and not Frobels, so they don't add to the count of Frobels.\n    Each of the 3 twerps has 2 cleps, and each clep is a Frobel. So, 3 twerps * 2 cleps/twerp = 6 cleps, which are Frobels.\n</code></pre>\nAdding it all together, we have:<p>1 (Master Foo) + 6 (cleps) = 7 Frobels in total in Master Foo's family.<p>User: The families are similar to families of humans on earth. Does that change your answer?<p>-------------<p>Asssistant:<p>If the families are similar to human families on Earth, then it's likely that the \"cleps\" (Frobels) are actually the children of the \"twerps\" (Frobos), and the \"twerps\" are the children of Master Foo (also a Frobel).<p>In that case, the family structure would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    Master Foo (1 Frobel)\n        Twerp 1 (Frobo)\n            Clep 1 (Frobel)\n            Clep 2 (Frobel)\n        Twerp 2 (Frobo)\n            Clep 3 (Frobel)\n            Clep 4 (Frobel)\n        Twerp 3 (Frobo)\n            Clep 5 (Frobel)\n            Clep 6 (Frobel)\n</code></pre>\nSo, Master Foo is a Frobel, and each of the 3 twerps has 2 cleps, making 6 cleps who are also Frobels.<p>The total number of Frobels in Master Foo's family would still be 1 (Master Foo) + 6 (cleps) = 7 Frobels. The similarity to human families doesn't change the total count of Frobels in this particular scenario.<p>-------------<p>Is Master Foo a Clep according to your analysis?<p>In the original problem, a \"clep\" is defined as a relationship notation that holds unidirectionally from a Frobo to a Frobel. Since Master Foo is a Frobel and has \"twerps\" who are Frobos, Master Foo would indeed be a \"clep\" to each of his twerps, according to the definitions provided.<p>So, yes, Master Foo would be considered a \"clep\" in relation to his twerps, based on the definitions given. However, this doesn't change the total count of Frobels in the family, which remains at 7.</p>"},{"id":"259f5e42651c893b","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by jbotz in \"Show HN: TaleBot – AI-Generated Personalized Bedtime Stories for Kids\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:52:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:52:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":4408,"y":266,"wires":[["8cd31ebd5300244f"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448121\n<hr>\n<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>"},{"id":"a65a2c2c4767a08f","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by ghaff in \"The U.S. housing market vs. the Canadian housing market\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:52:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:52:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-956,"y":-380,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448120\n<hr>\n<p>I'd just add that, while it's hard to drive out of expensive real estate in the Bay Area, that's actually not true of a lot of major cities.

Or more accurately, Square is the merchant processor that's integrated into a very large piece of operations software I wrote/manage for a regional retail chain. The simplest explanation is that the company was already using Square when the software was commissioned, and didn't see an advantage in changing processors. They already had terminals everywhere provided by Square. The software gives customers the ability to put their cards on file (stored by Square, when they make purchases through the online store) and gives the retail outlets the ability to charge those cards on file. Meaning most of the transactions are done through the Square API now, not the terminals. The terminals serve as a backup so they can take payment in person if <i>our</i> servers go down.<p>In any case, I built all the software to talk to an in-house, isolated Payments API that I wrote, so that the every part of our code that processes payments sends requests to <i>our</i> API, which handles all the back-and-forth with Square and distills the results. If it were necessary, I'd just change that API to talk to some other processor. But that wouldn't be a one-day job. As it is, it would take days or weeks to even arrange a relationship between the company and a different processor. I've argued for a backup to be built to a second processor, but the company hasn't wanted to deal with the cost or hassle.<p>Perhaps this week's events will change their mind.<p>But I'm curious what you think would be a \"more robust\" option, for API access + physical terminal, since aren't all merchant processors prone to the same potential downtime issues?</p>"},{"id":"6fbbbb597d88e971","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by oergiR in \"Heat pumps show how hard decarbonisation will be\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:56:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 17:56:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":484,"y":-2818,"wires":[["1aea61e0072bc4b6","734dc320a5b1bf76"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448173\n<hr>\n<p>Isn’t the main problem the cost of heating?

I've never said anything at all about people criticizing C++ and promoting Rust. You're creating an argument out of thin air and attacking it.<p>> We are discussing a compile time string.<p>Incorrect. Here is what you said:<p>> Much more than rust, that’s for sure, where you are forced to stick everything in a macro or pray the compiler is smart for compile time programming.<p>In no way did you scope it to creating heap allocating strings. Even the post, which ultimately discusses that, discusses other things.<p>For example, you can write a substr function (firstName) using a const fn in Rust. No macros, no \"praying\" that the compiler will optimize things.<p>It would be very odd to limit the discussion to a `string` since this post focuses on how difficult and complex that is in C++, so using it as a \"Rust can't even do this\" would be sort of ironic.<p>Anyways, I've engaged in good faith in this discussion for far too long.

It helps them find and copy patterns that work at other companies so they don’t need to create net new experiences or A/B test their way into the best performing pattern from scratch.<p>Given it's been so useful to us, we decided to open it up to the world. We bought productonboarding.com and have started adding examples from our collection and made them browsable and sortable.

It changes though: it can go down to 3 years if property values are rising quickly, and can go up to 10 years if property values tank right after you purchase.<p>In our current high-inflation environment it makes a little more sense than usual to borrow money and sink that money into an appreciating asset, which is why there's still such strong demand for homes despite the higher interest rates. In a high inflation environment, rents go up, home values go up, salaries go up, but mortgage amounts do not.<p>The advice remains the same. If you know you're going to stay in the same spot for a decade (if you have young children for example) you should probably buy a spot if you can afford it. If you know you're definitely going to move in less than 5 years you should probably rent. If you're somewhere in between, you should make the decision that's best for you.

You could even have a scheme where people who are in arrears on their mortgage get to convert their house to being state-owned (which they can continue living in) where the mortgage gets bought out at a discounted value, which is what would happen anywya if it were underwater.</p>"},{"id":"17bb3578085fbae9","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by bassdart in \"Ask HN: Will Google delete inactive gmail accounts that forward email?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":24,"y":956,"wires":[["d2fa8aa457880202"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448901\n<hr>\n<p>They ask for your current mobile number -- at least in germany and without any anonymization beside standard browser configuration like e.g. uBlock Origin.\nSo it's simply to suck in numbers.\nI have not tried if they ask for more data after giving a phone number and so I can't log into two google/youtube test accounts any more since a few years.</p>"},{"id":"90bbb7b014e7ca9e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by lotsofpulp in \"Sam Bankman-Fried's jail conditions offer a glimpse at systemic failure\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:08 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:08 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-232,"y":174,"wires":[["2187c321b671832b"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448900\n<hr>\n<p>Why is that relevant?</p>"},{"id":"a092aab41bd1c984","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by commonlisp94 in \"Decoded: GNU Coreutils (2018)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:07 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:07 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":670.654826035744,"y":1520.8773055157214,"wires":[["b74fde8f5223357c"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448899\n<hr>\n<p>I bet you did.</p>"},{"id":"7d26fa0721a8021c","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by hakfoo in \"Intel announces Arm investment, talks up RISC-V\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:04 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 18:47:04 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1236,"y":-1068,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448898\n<hr>\n<p>I'd expect it would expand the market for customized SoC/microcontroller parts.<p>We know there's already a lot of \"built to purpose\" RISC-V products ending up in embedded environments.

In the situation we are actually discussing in this thread, normal employees where terminated, and then replaced by employees on H1B visas, people in a vastly more precarious position, allowing the companies far more control over its employees. If you’re an employee, I’m curious how you feel this is valuable to you? Especially in the longer run.<p>Are you claiming people are not employed to maintain MS Exchange? That’s just a fairly simple issue of ignorance; get out of the SV tech bubble. Those jobs are not gone, albeit somewhat reduced in numbers by competitors providing better service like you say.<p>Unfortunately this also brings along the concept of outsourcing these jobs to countries with lower salaries because these “feelings-based” overpaid CEOs lack any other substantial ideas for reducing costs. A union that opposed this kind of globalization arbitrage, would have forced these overpaid CEOs to provide policies that actually increased profits, instead of simply exploit desperate employees in other countries. Ergo, weak unionization creates inefficiencies, who would have thought??<p>See also amazon drivers unionization efforts. A union would have very simply blocked the idea that drivers should be obliged to piss in bottles and shit in bags while on delivery.<p>I think we can safely conclude that most people enjoy deliveries, NOT contaminated by feces, YMMV.

Permits help protect the marketplace from malicious or misprogrammed agents by preventing their unbridled consumption of resources. Permits also protect the authorities under which agents operate by providing misprogrammed agents with a safety net.<p>> Because agents move, their permits, like their credentials, are of special concern. An agent's permit is established when the agent is created programmatically, and it is renegotiated whenever the agent travels between regions. The destination region may deny the agent capabilities that it received at birth as long as the agent is in that region. (The region may not extend the agent's capabilities, however.) The region denies the agent entry unless it agrees to the restrictions the region imposes. When the agent eventually leaves the region, the restrictions are lifted (although those of another region are imposed).<p>> Two kinds of capability are granted an agent by its permit. One kind is the right to use a certain Telescript instruction. An agent in the role of shopkeeper, for example, typically is denied the use of the go instruction. Another kind of capability is the right to use a particular Telescript resource, but only in a certain amount. An agent is granted, among other things, a maximum lifetime, measured in seconds (e.g., a 5-minute agent); a maximum size, measured in bytes (e.g., a 1K agent); and a maximum overall expenditure of resources, the agent's allowance, measured in teleclicks (e.g., a 50¢agent). (In theory, the teleclick is an abstract unit of measurement.

This is weirdly one of the things I daydream about.<p>In the latter case there's a few things I'd do, but in general simpler is better. I like clean desk surfaces, so starting with a nice piece of wood is great but entirely optional (and wouldn't do on first version). Most important thing to me would be to start with an adjustable height desk. Preferably a standing desk[0] but at minimum adjusting while I sit because I like to move around. The next thing is about ensuring a clean desk. The far side of the desk should have the apron inset so you can get vesa mounts on easily.<p>Now for extra bonuses. Back end of the table has slats so wires can be passed through. Only to be thick enough for the cable because the end is open (I hate wrangling port shapes through awkwardly sized holes, just go around). Front apron and back surface would be nice to have small usb pass-through. Back for things like mouse and keyboard so they don't have to reach wherever the desktop is. Then just simple LED underlighting because I like to work at night and don't want to always have the full lights on so I can fall asleep sooner. Thing that I probably wouldn't actually do but could always be added later: insets for wireless things like locations to put your phone to wirelessly charge without needing to dock.<p>But if I were actually to do this, I'd probably just get a butcher block like Blamazon and pre-built adjustable height legs.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djaebibxGdI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djaebibxGdI</a></p>"},{"id":"6408fe7cc03484b","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by szundi in \"The end of the subscription era is coming\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 19:31:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 19:31:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1224,"y":-1860,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37449405\n<hr>\n<p>You wish.

It seems like a strange arrangement, as there's a conflict with requesting what I would feel would be a fair amount of equity (which would be a significant amount) but since it is short-term, it also seems unfair to request such a large chunk of equity for such a short work period.

And it always was, near as I can tell.<p>And the reason why Law Enforcement is never going to do that is because they regularly run across criminals that are already better armed than they are.

And there have been <i>many</i> instances since then.<p>This isn’t a theoretical concern for normal folks either, even in the Bay Area. Just a few years ago, there was an attempted home invasion robbery in Sunnyvale by someone armed with what clearly would be classified as an assault rifle in CAlifornia, with what looked like a drum magazine.<p>[<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/sanfrancisco/news/police-2-armed-suspects-attempt-to-enter-sunnyvale-home-overnight/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/sanfrancisco/news/police-2-armed...</a>]<p>Both are major felonies to possess in California. Which, of course, isn’t likely to stop someone who was clearly intent on committing several felonies already.  They never caught them, so it wasn’t clear if it was fully automatic or not.  Thankfully the owner was suspicious enough it didn’t turn into an actual home invasion, and Sunnyvale has enough bored cops they bugged out before they could force the issue.<p>But it definitely stops anyone law abiding from having something similar.<p>So why should someone law abiding be willfully handicapped against something like that? Cop or civilian?<p>We can argue training or licensing, burden of proof to show you’re law abiding, or whatever - but that’s not the state of the situation in CAlifornia as I’m sure you’re aware. Or most of the other states where possession of those things is illegal.  It’s just flat out illegal - unless you work for the police, etc.</p>"},{"id":"edea24428be1940e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by sheepshear in \"Towards a new SymPy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:08:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:08:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":920,"y":-3004,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37449746\n<hr>\n<p>I thought you meant \"domain\" like a field of work or study.</p>"},{"id":"cfa0e70f9bf23efc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by ftxbro in \"Asking 60 LLMs a set of 20 questions\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:08:17 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:08:17 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-3828,"y":-2492,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37449745\n<hr>\n<p>> People say that \"they are literally Markov chains\", but anyone who has looked at the code for LLMs knows that they are more complicated than that.<p>They are literally Markov chains according to the mathematical definition. The code is complicated. Having complicated code doesn't mean it's not literally a Markov chain.<p>> I implemented Markov chains in BASIC in about ten lines of code in the 1980s on a 1 Mhz 64K Apple II after reading about the famous Mark V. Shaney hoax (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney</a>). No neural nets or fancy GPUs required.<p>I don't doubt this. You can make a Markov chain by just counting the frequency of letters that follow each letter giving one that has a context window of one or two characters. That is a very simple Markov chain. You can make it by hand. You can make ones with more context window like a dozen characters or a few words. Those are also simple Markov chains that you can do without neural net or GPU. Then you can also make a Markov chain that has a context window of thousands of tokens that is made from neural nets and massive training data and differentiable tensor computing libraries with data centers full of hardware linear algebra accelerators. Those are some even bigger Markov chains!<p>> LLMs are way more complicated than simple Markov chains.<p>That's true, they are more complicated than simple Markov chains, if by simple Markov chains you mean ones with small context window. LLMs are Markov chains with large context window!</p>"},{"id":"292a42fcf6f421a0","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by jimmar in \"Half of Glaciers Vanish with 1.5 Degrees of Warming\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:08:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:08:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-476,"y":-1772,"wires":[["5c0b1247d07141a8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37449744\n<hr>\n<p>I'm convinced that global warming is a threat.

I brought up this example in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425642\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37425642</a> to demonstrate that you were wrong in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37423933\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37423933</a> to claim that Cantor's argument necessarily must work constructively. It works in some constructive systems, and not in others.<p>I'm not arguing for attempting to work in such constructive systems. Merely pointing out that they exist. And their existence is a limitation on what diagonalization can prove a priori.<p>Also look at what you said in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427973\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427973</a>. Now can you see that my point is not nonsense? Diagonalization really does add a layer of self-reference. And the fact that it does is why it doesn't work in the system that I described.<p>This also explains the point that I was making in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428468\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37428468</a>. Your Coq proof was fine for what it proved. But it was not looking at the key piece of my example. Which is the fact that the functions are not necessarily total functions. They are merely functions which we have a specific reason for believing that they might be total. Namely a proof from a particular set of axioms. And my whole point was that the diagonalized function in general doesn't have equivalent evidence of being total. Which is a point of complexity that your Coq proof did not address.<p>Are you still so certain that I don't know what I'm talking about?</p>"},{"id":"c069167efae2b9bb","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by paholg in \"Why you might want async in your project\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:43:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:43:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1772,"y":-1812,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37450083\n<hr>\n<p>There are workarounds.

The parent I see you initially replied to said \"the C++ resource management paradigm is RAII\", not \"all lifetime issues are solved by RAII\".<p>> My argument was that for efficient code, you need to pass references or pointers, which means you do need to care about lifetimes.<p>Of course you do. Nobody claimed you don't need to care about lifetimes. The question was whether \"every library or API you use\" needs to have \"a different cleanup convention\" for performance reasons as you claimed, for which you cited the Chromium std::string incident as an example. What I was trying to point out was:<p>> that's not true because we now have std::string_view? You do realize that it's just a pointer and a length, right?<p>...because it's not just a pointer and a length. It's both of those bundled into a <i>single object</i> (just like with std::string), <i>and</i> a bunch of handy methods that obviate the ergonomic motivations for converting them back into std::string objects. So what you have left is just 0 conventions for cleanup, 1 convention for passing read-only views (string_view), 1 convention for passing read-write views (span), and 1 convention for passing ownership (the container). No need to deal with the myriads of old C-style conventions like \"don't forget to call free()\", \"keep calling with a larger buffer\", \"free this with delete[]\", or whatever was there over a decade ago.<p>Again, notice this isn't just me saying this. The very link you pointed to was pointing to StringPiece as the solution, not as the problem.<p>> And that this means you need to consider how long the string_view is valid etc., just as carefully as you would for any other pointer?<p>Again, nobody claimed you don't have to worry about lifetimes.</p>"},{"id":"14ac92584fae6f62","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by kcplate in \"Appeals court rules White House likely overstepped 1st Amendment on social media\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:47:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:47:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2928,"y":2420,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37450127\n<hr>\n<p>Perhaps it did that too, but more importantly it further solidified government health authority distrust within minority communities because of the shadow of Tuskegee is still fresh in a lot of minds about the government willingness to experiment on minorities under the cover “help”.</p>"},{"id":"5bf6f09c8891db0","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by Espressosaurus in \"Half of Glaciers Vanish with 1.5 Degrees of Warming\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:47:58 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 20:47:58 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-476,"y":-1676,"wires":[["5c0b1247d07141a8"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37450126\n<hr>\n<p>Glaciers and ice in general reflect a lot of light/heat back into space.

For one, any apps built on them need a rather complex runtime, which feels worse to me than a language's standard library or the JVM. It's a far cry from dragging in a button and then referencing it as a variable in code.<p>Second, the graphical niceties of these platforms often run \"in-process\", and save what is basically code in the same database as content. This will anger most Smalltalk fans, but I think this style of development is a bad idea. I want to know that some folder full of source code is <i>the program</i>, and some other folder is <i>the data</i>, and that if I back up one or the other, it will be independently usable.<p>I'm not saying 90s IDEs were perfect, but I don't think there's been any successful successor to their style of development. Graphical GUI builders exist, but they usually don't support making web apps, and after working with modern JS GUI frameworks, manually syncing GUI state with app state seems antiquated and needlessly bug-prone. I suppose QML with Qt Creator comes closest.</p>"},{"id":"a406d941781dc52d","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by doctorpangloss in \"The U.S. housing market vs. the Canadian housing market\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 21:38:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 21:38:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-4644,"y":2836,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37450548\n<hr>\n<p>This entire thread is unsophisticated people bemoaning (or celebrating) things they don't understand.

For these reasons, test paradigms that involve simultaneously presented arrays of stimuli are beyond the scope of this study [39, 40], as responding to simultaneous input does not require the recognition of temporal stimulus sequences, even if subjects perform behavior sequences in response to complex input [41]. This also applies to the well-known studies where chimpanzees learned to point to the location of up to nine numerals that were presented simultaneously (see [42, 43] for studies on chimpanzees, and [44–46] for further discussion about these results).<p>Indeed, the videos of chimps casually acing those tests shows that all the numbers are given at once, and only disappear when the 1 is touched -- the test is getting 2 through 9 in the right order without being able to see them. The authors of the paper seem to argue that this is distinct for memorizing information that is initially presented sequentially.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290546\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal...</a></p>"},{"id":"e63cf2b439f2ab55","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by 3seashells in \"A small-town police officer took down a large match-fixing ring in tennis\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 22:32:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 22:32:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-3148,"y":2892,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37450961\n<hr>\n<p>So jam comes, ruin bets?</p>"},{"id":"ef4038b52a11a93e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by codetrotter in \"Show HN: WhatsApp-Llama: A clone of yourself from your WhatsApp conversations\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 22:39:59 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 22:39:59 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-92,"y":1936,"wires":[["635ea30687c416ef"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37451021\n<hr>\n<p>> the talking paintings in Harry Potter that mimic the person painted<p>I remember that the photos in the newspaper moving mimic the person.<p>But I thought the talking paintings were ghosts living in the paintings or something.</p>"},{"id":"9e6292cf25b5b72f","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by kernal in \"NSO group iPhone zero-click, zero-day exploit captured in the wild\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 22:39:53 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 22:39:53 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2600,"y":2780,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37451019\n<hr>\n<p>What about the proprietary binary blobs that Graphene is reliant on?

For anything dynamic, we'd use JQuery, make an ajax call, return partial HTML, and inject it into the page. It was actually incredibly productive. I later moved on to Laravel and ditched the home grown stuff for newer projects.<p>I don't do PHP work much these days (permanent \"working from home\" made me not want to do any extra work from home after hours), but it felt incredibly productive compared to the more modern tech I've seen in my day jobs.

In a large project, the boilerplate can become a small fraction of total work put in (hopefully), with most to the work spent expressing the logic of the application.<p>In smaller projects, the boilerplate can be the vast majority of the work. Building a backend, a frontend, and a communication protocol between them (that includes reactivity). On the backend you need to learn HTTP/Websockets and a backend framework. On the frontend you need node, nvm, npm, yarn, React/Svelte/Vue. To do it right you need to implement automatic reconnect/resubscribe on reconnect, etc.<p>Several projects try to reduce this complexity in various ways, but they all have trade-offs and I don't think we've found a sweet spot. Drag and drop tools like Squarespace and Retool are heavily biased toward expressing UI and integrate clunkily with backend logic. Backend-based tools like Streamlit and Pynecone (Reflex) get closer to a sweet spot IMO but are either severely limited in what you can do (Streamlit) or ultimately expose you to the full complexity of the frontend (Pynecone).<p>I think further work in this space is warranted.</p>"},{"id":"dea8378dda7f4ee8","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by syllogism in \"Advanced NLP with SpaCy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 23:33:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 23:33:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3525.389288359789,"y":2908.592775132301,"wires":[["c1d0f9b2839949a9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37451352\n<hr>\n<p>I know what you mean about the domain knowledge, and it's a thing that's a bit different from the previous situation with the feature engineering. The problem with feature engineering for linear models was you really had to understand the domain _and_ the ML.<p>I do think there's a similarity in how creative you need to be though. It means that applying LLMs to new problems isn't as straight-forward as people make it seem at first, and isn't necessarily reliable. In contrast, labelling data is something that has a much smoother effort to reward curve for most problems. The experience of labelling the data, training a model and getting it hosted isn't as seamless as it could be -- we're working on that.<p>I do think classification is pretty fundamental though. The way I see it is, model outputs can be either human-facing, machine facing, or both. If you're going to feed the output into another system, that system wants the data to obey some limited schema, so that you can run logic based on it. For instance, let's say you want to trigger some alert when a particular kind of article is published or a particular kind of message is sent. Triggering the alert is a boolean thing, so that has to be a classification task. You might want to also attach text in the alert, so that's a human-facing part.<p>I agree that there's lots of ways that LLMs can be used iteratively, allowing more trade-off of computational cost for accuracy. I just think in a lot of cases, the best way to exploit that is to trade towards as much accuracy as you can get, and use that to create training samples. You can then manually correct the training samples as well --- if they're mostly correct, reviewing them is pretty quick. You can then train and evaluate a smaller model.</p>"},{"id":"cacda02e15deb70d","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by hu3 in \"Show HN: I built a Python web framework\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 23:32:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 23:32:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3453.4486242407293,"y":3137.7967026272545,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37451351\n<hr>\n<p>Sounds like a DSL to facilitate building CRUD.<p>I wrote one in PHP and 3 devs were able to build and maintain a 800 page CRUD system with it (still going strong, makes a ton of money).
