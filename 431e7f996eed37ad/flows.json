That was a last minute decision. In retrospect I think what pushed me over the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall. The density of startup people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the weather was so nice. I remembered that from living there in the 90s. Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. I wanted YC to be the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. So doing the winter batch in California seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice and the ambitious one were the same.</i><p>> <i>If we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would have been in Berkeley. That was our favorite part of the Bay Area. But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley. We didn't have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View. Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the ideal place to put something like YC. But even then we barely made it. The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.</i> [0]<p>and, from 2007:<p>> <i>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is not even a nationalistic one. It's the same thing I say to startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every 6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to move to Silicon Valley.

That's not nothing and it's something that you can get started with super quickly. But you'll have slow responses and typically a 3rd party running the inference.<p>Annotating data yourself to about 2000-3000 examples, on the datasets that I ran my benchmarks on, may get you closer to 80-90%.

In fact, I think you could probably just learn both of them on top of what you're doing in Rust since the time investment is negligible compared to it in the long run.<p>With regards to the upsides in terms of writing code in a performance-aware manner:<p>- It's easier to look at a piece of code and confidently say it's not doing any odd or potentially bad things with regards to performance in both Odin and Zig<p>- Both languages emphasize custom allocators which are a great boon to both application simplicity, flexibility and performance (set up limited memory space temporarily and make sure we can never use more, set up entire arenas that can be reclaimed or reused entirely, segment your resources up in different allocators that can't possibly interfere with eachother and have their own memory space guaranteed, etc.)<p>- No one can use one-at-a-time constructs like RAII/`Drop` behind your back so you don't have to worry about stupid magic happening when things go out of scope that might completely ruin your cache, etc.<p>To borrow an argument from Rust proponents, you should be thinking about these things (allocation patterns) anyway and you're doing yourself a disservice by leaving them up to magic or just doing them wrong. If your language can't do what Odin and Zig does (pass them around, and in Odin you can inherit them from the calling scope which coupled with passing them around gives you incredible freedom) then you probably should try one where you can and where the ecosystem is based on that assumption.<p>My personal experience with first Zig and later Odin is that they've provided the absolute most productive experience I've ever had when it comes to the code that I had to write. I had to write more code in because both ecosystems are tiny and I don't really like extra dependencies regardless. Being able to actually write your dependencies yourself but have it be such a productive experience is liberating in so many ways.<p>Odin is my personal winner in the race between Odin and Zig. It's a very close race but there are some key features in Odin that make it win out in the end:<p>- There is an implicit `context` parameter primarily used for passing around allocator and a logger that can be implicitly used for calls if you don't specify one. This makes your code less chatty and let's you talk only about the important things in some cases. I still prefer to be explicit about allocators in most plumbing but I'll set `context.allocator` to some appropriate choice for smaller programs in `main` and let it go<p>- We can have proper tagged unions as errors and the language is built around it. This gives you code that looks and behaves a lot like you'll be used to with `Result` and `Option` in Rust, with the same benefits.<p>- Errors are just values but the last value in a multiple-value-return function is understood as the error position if needed so we avoid the `if error != nil { ... }` that would otherwise exist if the language wasn't made for this. We can instead use proper error values (that can be tagged unions) and `or_return`, i.e.:<p><pre><code>    doing_things :: proc() ParsingError {\n        parsed_data := parse_config_file(filename) or_return\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf we wanted to inspect the error this would instead be:<p><pre><code>    // The zero value for a union is `nil` by default and the language understands this\n    ParsingError :: union {\n        UnparsableHeader,\n        UnparsableBody,\n    }\n\n    UnparsableHeader :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    UnparsableBody :: struct {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    doing_things :: proc() {\n        parsed_data, parsing_error := parse_config_file(filename)\n        // `p in parsing_error` here unpacks the tag of the union\n        // Notably there are no actual \"constructors\" like in Haskell\n        // and so a type can be part of many different unions with no syntax changes\n        // for checking for it.\n        switch p in parsing_error {\n        case UnparsableHeader:\n            // In this scope we have an `UnparsableHeader`\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_header(p)\n        case UnparsableBody:\n            function_that_deals_with_unparsable_body(p)\n        }\n\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n- ZVI or \"zero-value initialization\" means that all values are by default zero-initialized and have to have zero-values. The entire language and ecosystem is built around this idea and it works terrifically to allow you to actually talk only about the things that are important, once again.</p>"},{"id":"3ce51bafcee2517a","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by aap_ in \"The Development of the C Language (2003)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 08:39:51 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-728,"y":340,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443379\n<hr>\n<p>What's fascinating is that I recently found some code that I believe was written in NB [1].

The toll road is for general traffic and as the name suggests requires paying a toll to use. The access road is only for use by traffic to/from the airport and is toll free. Using the access road to avoid paying the toll is illegal, but this is exactly what Google Maps has begun to suggest.

The idea is to fork, then LD_PRELOAD the other program and overwrite its read functions (and equivalents to also capture inlined read functions). The child process loads some solver which will try to read its input from STDIN. The overwritten read is triggered and instead of just reading, our library shim connects to the parent process. The parent process feeds the child with data, the shim converting the data into text, feeding it to the solver as if it would be reading from a file. Now once we are finished with stating the problem and want to query it (i.e. send assumptions, in QBF or SAT solver speech), we issue a fork command, which lets the child process fork again into a second process, while the solver program thinks it is still in the read() call. We then feed the assumptions only to this grandchild, close its STDIN, and return the result to the calling parent process. When there's another assumption, we can issue the fork again and send assumptions to the new instance, never having to process the full problem again\nThis is nice when the formula is large and the assumptions are small and numerous, which (e.g. for parallelization) was very useful in our research.\nThe copy on write nature of fork() of course also helps, effectively reducing the required RAM to keep solvers in memory. \nThe best of all this, it works remarkably well on Linux and is even (mostly) POSIX conforming!\nCheck out our paper: <a href=\"https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3201/paper1.pdf</a>\nOr just the code: <a href=\"https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi\">https://github.com/maximaximal/quapi</a></p>"},{"id":"beb2978c04618625","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by michaelteter in \"JIT-optimized Ruby can outperform a C extension\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:39 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-568,"y":1404,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443493\n<hr>\n<p>I think the point of the essay is that we shouldn’t immediately assume that going to C is the best way to speed up part of a Ruby system.<p>It might be conventional wisdom to break out to C for the speed gain, but a purpose made, hand written piece of Ruby, with JIT optimizations, and be a better/faster solution.</p>"},{"id":"dc953edefa4a4fdc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by eastbound in \"North Korean campaign targeting security researchers\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:07:37 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":320,"y":1684,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443492\n<hr>\n<p>As a startup delivering executables to customers, I decently trust most programs running in the company: Gimp, Libreoffice, Docker, IntelliJ… There are only 4 major things that download unchecked stuff and run them:<p>- IntelliJ plugins,<p>- Maven,<p>- NPM,<p>- GitHub Actions.<p>Jetbrains says it carefully reviews the source code of all versions of all plugins, and Maven has a somewhat decent dependency tree that you can restrict to major actors (Spring-Apache-Google).<p>Maybe the key to trust would be to have larger pieces of code (such as Spring) with quite a lot of process to check-in code, rather than a thousand NPM packages.

Text search and highlighting, where you need to do things like performing word stemming or lemmatization on the search input, find matching documents, and highlight spans.<p>Also, LLMs have a different tokenization model, so you have tokens like \"don\"/\"'t!\" -- this makes them difficult to work with in downstream NLP applications where having words, numbers, punctuation, and symbols as specific tokens are more useful.<p>NLP is not a solved task, as things like part of speech classification (identifying nouns, adjectives, etc.) are not 100% accurate, and tend to have a lower sentence accuracy compared to word accuracy.</p>"},{"id":"e08c079aeaf3e8fd","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by soneil in \"Consumers defrauded on Zelle are left high and dry by the banks that created it [pdf]\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:10 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:10 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1120,"y":3196,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443614\n<hr>\n<p>I assume everyone's familiar with the overpayment scam - it's probably the second most common cheque scam after simply passing bad cheques in the first place.  You're accidentally paid too much, and are asked to return the remainder, or pass it on to someone else.  Then the original cheque bounces and you're out product plus the remainder you passed along.<p>This version relies on banks being required to make \"funds available\" in a timeframe that's often shorter than how long it takes a cheque to actually clear - so you can dig yourself into a hole before the cheque finally bounces.<p>The zelle version is essentially the same thing.  Someone \"accidentally\" sends you a sum, and being a nice, reasonable person, you return it.  The problem is this isn't a rollback; you don't (can't) revert their transaction - you create a second transaction.<p>So when the source of the original transaction turns out to be fraudulent - and as the parent post says, fraudulent can be reverted, the house always wins - that first transaction is reverted. The second, where you \"returned\" their overpayment, is an entirely distinct transaction and needs to be fought separately.  And it's a much harder fight to win, because it doesn't involve the house winning.<p>(And yes, this could be almost entirely mitigated by having a user-facing return/revert/refund function that undoes the original transaction instead of creating a second.)</p>"},{"id":"e207884d0c027dad","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by kprotty in \"Maybe Rust isn’t a good tool for massively concurrent, userspace software\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:01 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:32:01 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1926.2804988841208,"y":1544.6045706599195,"wires":[["3ca3b54616f901f2"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443612\n<hr>\n<p>To run async in Drop in rust, you need to use block_on() as you can't natively await (unlike in Go).

They are still slower than <i>not</i> going through the boundary at all, naturally, but that’s about it. On the other hand, going through the Lua/C API inherited from the original, interpreted implementation—which sounds similar to what the Ruby blog post is comparing pure-Ruby code to—<i>can</i> be quite slow.<p>The SWC situation I can’t understand quickly, but apart from the WASM overhead it sounds to me like they have a syntax tree that the JS plugin side really wants to be GCed in the GC’s memory but the Rust-on-WASM host side really wants to be refcounted in WASM memory, and that is indeed not a good situation to be in. It took a decade or more for DOM manipulation in JS to not suck, and there the native-code side was operating with deep hooks into the VM and GC infrastructure as opposed to the WASM straitjacket. Hopefully it’ll become easier when the WASM GC proposal finally materializes and people figure out how to make Rust target it.<p>In any case, it puzzles me how hard it is in just about any low-level language to cheaply integrate with a GC. Getting a stack map out of a compiler in order to know where the references to GC-land are and when they are alive is like pulling teeth. I don’t think it should be that way.</p>"},{"id":"a3f503f06adf25e6","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by marcomourao in \"LogoScale – A method for vectorizing small, crappy logos\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:50:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:50:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":720,"y":-444,"wires":[["71823eccadcfff0d"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443697\n<hr>\n<p>I'm a graphic designer and Vector Magic[1] still is my gold standard for vectorizing logos.

Once in my career I encountered something similar. The first interesting thing I learned about promissory estoppel was that it wasn’t really “law” but rather a legal concept. As such, things are a bit more vague than the typical legal dispute.<p>Secondly, the lawyer told me that it was only possible to take that route if one had not officially signed an employment contract. The reasoning is that once you’ve signed a contract, you’re technically an employee and your claim would be handled in a different manner. But in many jurisdictions, the wronged person would be treated as having been fired at will and would not have much recourse (as opposed to a promissory estoppel claim)<p>The other concepts in play were common sense things, like the company had to made you a reasonable offer, you took reasonable actions based on that promise, and the company knew you were taking those actions. And finally, the “penalty” is often only the documented losses you really incurred which can seem tiny in comparison to the situation and intangible losses. I suspect many of these cases are settled before going to court.<p>IANAL and YMMV</p>"},{"id":"6cd9c74130e26920","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by manishmshiva in \"What Is Cybersecurity Forensics?

It has no legitimate interest in mandating statistical data-collection about online speech, either: because there's no legitimate government function that data serves and informs. (You have no legitimate interest in casing in the bank's vaults because there's no plausible lawful action you can do with that information).<p>If you're having trouble sympathizing with the civics because the defendant, X, is horrible, and X users are horrible—just flip to a hypothetical where it's the government position that's horrible. Like so: \"the DeSantis government of Florida has mandated social media platforms disclose statistics about LGBT content on their platforms\". Does this make it easier to see how (0) indirect laws about speech (i.e. mandatory statistics) intrinsically have chilling effects on that speech, and (1) \"mere data-collection\" about speech doesn't obviously serve any legitimate government function? (Political signalling isn't a legitimate government function). And: suppose the mandatory forms you have to fill out for DeSantis Transparency list LGBT content using some highly offensive, homophobic language.

Introduction of namespaces is an improvement but it does not change the fact that everything is in global scope. The best practice for imports is to not include them outside of execution context, but it also makes it very hard to reason about what is actually being used by the file + you try to think about not loading files unnecessarily so it's not uncommon to add the import statement in the same file multiple times before using something and there are no type hints that say whether the include was imported or not. Which is more or less a consquence of the environment not having a proper runtime and everything being re-initialized with every request (in a runtime context, all files that would ever by used would be included, because they would be used eventually). I genuinely wonder how it came to be that a language developed specifically to serve web requests is not a loop, you would think that a runtime would be especially useful for handling requests and Facebook learned it the hard way, heck CLI input -> output programs are probably the only type of program where it would not be a limitation.</p>"},{"id":"2af8335a3458edcc","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by narism in \"Teen’s death after eating a single chip highlights risks of ultra-spicy foods\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:19:14 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:19:14 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":572,"y":-44,"wires":[["6a04b3ef5b4f4cfd"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443825\n<hr>\n<p>The source/other articles [1][2][3] mention this particular chip has sent multiple other students to the hospital before.

I always doubted these figures (I'm a PHP dev myself, so I wouldn't mind these figures being true).\nI think the methodology is shady. I wonder if they use what the server indicates. I think some servers like Apache with php mod send this information to the client in a header. But most servers don't. Therefore they maybe use this as \"from all the servers giving a backend language information, PHP represents 77%\" which wouldn't be surprising. The question is how many websites in your data don't give any information about the language used under the hood?<p>I think we should stop using these numbers. GitHub uses ruby on rails but we know it from the developer team, not from what the server tells us. How many websites communicate about their backend infrastructure?<p>I don't doubt Wordpress powers many websites out there. But I'm tired of these figures which don't mean anything to me. Especially that if you look for all job ads, PHP isn't so big (except in some PHP-centric countries like France).<p>You can't just make up numbers. If you give me statistics, give me the methodology you used and all the details. Otherwise I suggest we all start to say Haskell powers 87% of the web.

LLMs can mean a bunch of different things, people call models the size of BERT LLMs sometimes. So let's talk specifically about in-context learning (ICL) with either zero or a few examples. So we'll say LLM ICL, and contrast that with techniques where you annotate enough data to train with, which might only be something like 10-40 hours of annotation. The something you do with that data is probably training a task-specific classification model initialised with weights from a language modelling objective. This is sometimes called \"fine-tuning\", but fine-tuning can also mean taking an LLM and adapting its ICL. So we'll just call it \"training\", and the fact you use transfer learning like BERT or even word vectors is just tactics.<p>Okay. So, here's something that might surprise you: ICL actually sucks at most predictive tasks currently. Let's take NER. Performance on NER on some datasets is _below 2003_. Here's some recent discussion: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mayhewsw/status/1700139745769046409\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/mayhewsw/status/1700139745769046409</a><p>The discussion focusses on how bad the CoNLL 2003 dataset is, and indeed it's a crap dataset. But experiments have also been done on other datasets, e.g. check out the comparison of ICL and training in this paper from Microsoft: <a href=\"https://universal-ner.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://universal-ner.github.io/</a> . When GPT4 is used this one paper reports it slightly better on some tasks: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092</a> . Frustratingly they don't do enough GPT4 experiments. This other paper also does a huge number of experiments, but not with GPT4: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10092</a><p>The findings across the literature are really clear. ICL is generally much worse than training a model in accuracy, and you generally don't need much training data to get there.<p>For tasks like text classification, ICL sometimes does okay. But you need to pick the problem characteristics carefully. Most text classification tasks people actually want to do have something like 20 labels, the texts are kind of long, and the labels don't capture the category especially well. Applying ICL to such tasks is very non-trivial. Your prompt balloons up if you have lots of classes to predict between, and providing the examples is hard if your texts are even a few hundred words.<p>Let's say you want to do something <i>ultra</i> simple: classify articles into categories for some news site or blog. This is the type of problem text classifiers have been eating for breakfast for 20 years. This is not a difficult problem -- a unigram bag of words does fine, and the method of estimating the weights can be almost anything, like just averaged perceptron will be totally okay.<p>But how will an LLM be able to do this? Probably your topic categories include several different types of article under it. If you know what those types of article are you can separate them out and make sure they're represented in the prompt. But now we're back at needing a tonne of domain knowledge about your problem -- that's like having to write custom features to make your model work. We all switched to deep learning so we wouldn't have to do that.<p>LLMs build a much more sophisticated representation of the meaning of the data to classify. But then you give them very few examples of the <i>problem</i>. So they can only build a shallow function from this deep representation. If you have lots of examples, you can learn a complex function from shallower features. For a great many classification tasks, this is better. The rest of your system usually needs the classification module to have some sort of consistent behaviours anyway. To do that, you basically have to make an annotation manual, and then you want to annotate evaluation documents. Once you're there the effort to make training data and train a model is minimal.<p>The other elephant in the room is the expense of the LLM solutions. The papers are missing results on GPT4 not because they're lazy, but because it's so expensive to use GPT4 as a classification solution that they want to get the rest of their results out the door.<p>The world cannot migrate all its current NLP models for text classification and NER to ICL. There are nowhere near enough GPUs in the world for that to happen. And I don't know about you, but I expect the number of text classification and NER models to <i>grow</i>, not shrink. So, the idea that we'll stop training small models for these tasks is just implausible. The OpenAI models that support batching are almost viable for prediction, but models like GPT4 don't support it (perhaps due to the mixture of experts?), so it's super slow.<p>The other thing is, many aspects of language that are useful as annotations are consistent linguistic features. The English language codes for proper names and numeric entities. They behave differently in the grammar. So some sort of named entity annotation can be done once, and then the model trained and reused. This is what spaCy does. We do this for a variety of other useful annotations across languages. We actually need to do much more: we need to collect new annotations for these models to keep them up to date, and we need to do this for more tasks, such as semantic role labelling. But it's definitely a good way to reuse work. We can do this annotation once, train the models, and users can reuse the models.<p>The strength of ICL is that you can get started very easily, without doing the work of annotation and training. There's lots of research on making ICL few-shot learning less bad on arbitrary text classification, NER and other tasks. We're working hard to take these results from the literature and build best-practice prompts and parsers you can use as a drop-in annotation module in spaCy: <a href=\"https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm\">https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm</a> . Our annotation tool Prodigy also supports initializing the annotations from an LLM, and just correcting the output: <a href=\"https://prodigy.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://prodigy.ai</a> . The idea is to let you start with an LLM, and then transition to a model you train yourself, which can be run much faster.</p>"},{"id":"d38238c58b04ee2f","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by dash2 in \"The PGP Problem (2019)\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:30 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:30 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":2586,"y":-1284,"wires":[["5d67fb7e0ef8c8b5"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443920\n<hr>\n<p>This seems like part of a more general phenomenon: shonky or outdated 2000s open source software getting in the way of progress.</p>"},{"id":"2cd231df68f6a5f4","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by IdiranVibe in \"Safety inspector fired for finding 'too many defects'\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:29 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 10:43:29 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-3080,"y":1516,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37443919\n<hr>\n<p>> at most city speeds<p>This is exactly it!

I'll cede the argument about the e-commerce platforms and CRMs, but I'm just not convinced that PHP is where a budding developer should be focusing their efforts. You enter the business/corporate world and there are tons of applications out there running the world, not just websites. Those applications are predominantly written in languages like .NET, Java, JS/ECMAScript, Python, Rust, and Go. Also, among the managed languages like .NET/Java/JS the knowledge is quite transferrable and sometimes almost identically named.<p>I'm not trying to bash PHP as a language, but every time I see this argument it's the same. Evangelizing PHP also seems to come with a requirement to mention Wordpress, Wikipedia, and Facebook. I'm sure there's money to be made in PHP, and I'm sure it's a great language for the internet. But learning .NET or Java is likely to have a much larger window of opportunity. Also, if you have a specific industry you want to work in you should be looking at the language predominately sought after in that industry.<p>I think this is why a lot of developers bash PHP, it's not that it's a non-valid choice. It's that it has limited applicability.

The reason why it happens are complex, but it boils down to energy. All such diseases have a common trait: they cause disruption of ATP production at the cellular level, affecting mitochondria. Then comes a cascading effect: without sufficient levels of energy, cells start to degrade. At early stages, it mostly affects high-energy cells like those in the brain and the rest of nervous system. Then comes the liver and muscles (including heart). At the end stage, the effect may cause a multiorgan failure and even death.<p>A reason why diets affect this situation so much is two-fold. First, a diet affects microbiota, causing stagnation and proliferation of selected species. Second, the diet affects cells and its organelles, especially mitochondria. For example, some acquired mitochondrial damages can be reversed by a sufficient supply of vitamins and minerals in combination with the right balance of carbohydrates and fats in the diet.<p>It is worth to remember that one has to eliminate the initial disruption factor that caused the problem in the first place. Be it infection, poison, or something else.

Ruby is still not \"fast\" (but I haven't tested it with yjit yet). I put up with it because I know I can make it significantly faster later.<p>As it turns out for a whole lot of things Ruby is slow for people because one of the nice things about programming in Ruby a lot of the time is expressing the problem the more readable way first rather than paying attention to performance. When people are aware, it makes it easy to iterate fast and fix performance later. The problem is a lot of the time that leads to pathological cases of people not thinking this through at all.<p>You'll notice most of his performance increase came from writing better Ruby. Clearly the original Graphql parser was nowhere near optimal. It's worth keeping in mind that writing a C extension ought to be a last resort after making the Ruby as fast as you can first, because often that means you don't need to.<p>E.g. another of Aaron's recent articles is about speeding up a parser by cutting down on object creation, and one specific example he gave was to return just the token type from the lexer instead of [token_type, token_value]. The latter forced creation of an Array object to hold each token and a string object for the token value (though for fixed tokens you could avoid that by returning the same frozen string literal), and for a whole lot of tokens the parser had no interest in the token string (e.g. if you see :lparen, or :rparen, getting \"(\" and \")\" is entirely uninteresting). When people run into slow Ruby code like that it's tempting to resort to C right away, rather than understand <i>why</i> their Ruby is slow.<p>I love that yjit makes it <i>easier</i> to get to a point where you don't need to reach for C, though.</p>"},{"id":"96e701f268efb8e1","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by xattt in \"The Carrington Event of 1859 and the Potential for a “Miyake Event”\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:34 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:34 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-268,"y":2076,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444024\n<hr>\n<p>[delayed]</p>"},{"id":"2ea88f4f4f240ef9","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"X challenges California’s new transparency law as unconstitutional\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:21 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:21 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3073,"y":2580,"wires":[["54d4ad4c6871984b"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444023\n<hr>\n<p>- <i>\"Section 230 immunizes the supposed expressive content of X's editorial policy\"</i><p>The First Amendment protects the expressive content of X's editorial policy.<p>- <i>\"X shouldn't have as free rein to run that program in secret according to unknown whims.\"</i><p>The First Amendment protects secretive editorial policies run according to editors' whims.</p>"},{"id":"d33a61857caac4e","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by matthewmorgan in \"Ask HN: Good Books on Universal Basic Income?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:18 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:04:18 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":712,"y":-312,"wires":[["c3efbf98faced87a"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444022\n<hr>\n<p>Not a book but look up Milton Friedman's remarks on negative income tax.

It was back compatible with php 5.x including bugs and sometime poorly designed interface and used WordPress, MediaWiki testing suite to ensure they caught any regressions. The team behind HHVM probably saved Facebook from crippling capex / operating costs and at Wikimedia we literally halved the CPU load when we switched. At the time Facebook and Wikimedia ran PHP 5.3 or 5.4 and both had performance issues  or at least concern with the huge amount of CPU required for their workload.<p>HHVM had some optional language feature on top of PHP such as typing and some helpful additional functions, that became the Hack language which is essentially a fork of the PHP language.<p>All the work on HHMV and the nice performances from it eventually challenged PHP which with PHP v7 came with a similar VM / Jit system. At that point, the performance benefices of running HHVM vs php v7 where not justifying the extra complexity (notably lack of garbage collector by choice, or complexity in deploying the sqlite bytecode holind the code to be executed).

I'm more familiar with the primate literature, so I looked over the study and the book summary.<p>The Herman study was published in 1984, which was already a few years after the collapse of most of the primate language efforts. So, the author tries to compensate for many of the flaws that spelled doom in the primate teaching efforts.<p>In particular, they do a decent job of focusing on comprehension rather than language generation, and wisely test primarily novel sentences.<p>On the other hand, they make the same error as the primate researchers in not fully addressing if, and to what extent if so, operant conditioning could also be the method of learning. The response to novel sentences and the 5-word sentences seems suggestive of language, but conditioning can also do a LOT. (E.g., look up rats trained to do Rube Goldberg-style mazes involving dozens of steps to see how complicated behaviors can be achieved by conditioning smaller subpieces and then chaining them.)<p>The novel sentence tests might still be explainable by conditioning as: the dolphins are rewarded for correct answers, and by combining operant conditioning with object identification, are able to infer the correct answer. E.g., they trained a dolphin to answer yes/no on whether a hoop was in the pool, and then asked the same question for items used in earlier studies. This could still be a generalization of a conditioning response from a smart animal receiving rewards for correct answers, and not a demonstration of syntactical understanding.</p>"},{"id":"b9908744babf2bf","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by soneca in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:54:44 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:54:44 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-3132,"y":-1620,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444322\n<hr>\n<p>I recently lost a few games of Memory (or Concentration/Matching Pairs [0]) to a child.<p>I wasn’t really trying, but I think she wasn’t either.

They ask ChatGPT to evaluate the truthfulness of new headlines outside its training data cutoff, don’t show it the source of the headline (e.g. a reputable news outlet or not), and don’t allow it to to use an internet search to determine if the news is corroborated.<p>So their claim that it’s “ineffective” seems like a pretty big overreach.

I was in the hobbyist community as a younger teen since the beginning of pi till 2016-17. When I stopped at that time ESP8266 had just so much potential as the cheap microcontroller with wifi and RPi Zero W as the cheap microcontroller with wifi as well. The development environment had improved so much over the years and things seemed great. The alternative pi clones also were building their own identity and figuring out their software.\nOver the years I felt guilty for not experimenting given that Rpi4 had 8 gigs of ram! and surely the competition would be better. I bought a bunch of Zeros, ESPs and 4s when I couldn't find other alternatives much but surely that was because I was out of the community and didn't know what to buy. And surely there would have been ESP alternative in all these years with lower power alternatives now that IOT is going to be a bigger thing finally.\nAlas, last year I came back to the hobbyist scene finally! Excited! And it was all a major disappointment. All my favourite hobbyist stores in my country had shut down or increased prices for basically everything by a huge margin. It all seemed more polished but so much more void of the vibrancy of the earlier scene. All the experimental boards sort of failing. And I can't even buy the boards anymore. Thankfully I could retrieve all the boards I had bought in past so didn't have to chase boards in flash sales as everyone else I knew had to. \nBut it's so sad.</p>"},{"id":"959ac95b7f444910","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by jerrygenser in \"Advanced NLP with SpaCy\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:12:06 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:12:06 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1050,"y":-316,"wires":[["c1d0f9b2839949a9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444422\n<hr>\n<p>LLM are not somewhat fast when measured against CPU models in spacy that are specialized for a task.

There are multiple genuinely free e-file providers and most people could easily file their taxes themselves on paper.<p>That said, while I agree the IRS situation can be dramatically improved - move the Free Fillable Forms program to the irs.gov domain instead of just linking to it, for starters, or just buy out one of the extant free programs and incorporate it - takes like this miss a lot of important factors.<p>1. US taxpayers are filing federal <i>and state</i> taxes. The state tax revenue agencies are completely independent of the IRS. While free federal filing would be nice, you've only solved no-more-than 50% of my problem. (Many people have to file in multiple states.)<p>2. This is relatively well known, but the US tax code is generally more complicated than many other countries. This isn't so much of a problem except that US taxpayers are obsessed with making sure the government doesn't get one over on them. They are always on the lookout for deductions and credits, frequently that they <i>may</i> not even be actually eligible for. I personally know a lot of people who have illegitimately claimed commuting mileage on their taxes, for example. So the complexity is a <i>desired feature</i>, not something you can just remove without consequence.<p>3. Because of the US federal system and US privacy rights, most countries collect much more information about their citizens than the US federal government. The IRS and the US federal government does not even know where you live until you tell it. They don't know what, if any, children you actually have living with you - which at $2000 tax <i>credit</i> per kid, is extremely important information when calculating your tax bill.<p>4. This is an issue that mostly affects educated upper-middle class people, not lower income people. I have struggled to convince most lower income people to use free! tax prep software at <i>all</i>. Most of them are paying companies and individuals to do their taxes, convinced that some guy with an office has the power to arm-wrestle the IRS and get them more back on their tax refund than anyone else via secret loopholes that don't exist on the 1040EZ. (They are wrong, except to the degree the less circumspect filers definitely commit lots of tax fraud.) You will never, ever convince these people to use the IRS website to file their taxes - that's walking into the enemy camp, in their minds. On top of this, they are convinced that making a tiny mistake on their taxes will result in severe fines and penalties and possibly imprisonment, despite the fact the IRS generally is very amenable to working with you.

Modern PHP feels more like writing TypeScript vs JS, there’s real safety and a much better developer experience now.

In this repo, I was able to emulate NES ROMs in Ghidra to test its 6502 specification, which resulted in finding and fixing some bugs.<p>Context: Ghidra is used for reverse engineering binary executables, complementing the usual disassembly view with function decompilation. Each supported architecture has a SLEIGH specification, which provides semantics for parsing and emulating instructions, not unlike the dispatch handlers you would find in interpreters written for console emulators.<p>Emulator devs have long had extensive test ROMs for popular consoles, but Ghidra only provides CPU emulation, so it can't run them without additional setup. What I did here is bridge the gap: by modifying a console emulator to instead delegate CPU execution to Ghidra, we can now use these same ROMs to validate Ghidra processor modules.<p>Previously [1], I went with a trace log diffing approach, where any hardware specific behaviour that affected CPU execution was also encoded in trace logs. However, it required writing hardware specific logic, and is still not complete. With the delegation approach, most of this effort is avoided, since it's easier to hook and delegate memory accesses.<p>I plan on continuing research in this space and generalizing my approaches, since it shows potencial for complementing existing test coverage provided by pcodetest. If a simple architecture like 6502 had a few bugs, who knows how many are in more complex architectures! I wasn't able to find similar attempts (outside of diffing and coverage analysis from trace logs), please let me know if I missed something, and any suggestions for improvements.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/nevesnunes/ghidra-tlcs900h#emulation\">https://github.com/nevesnunes/ghidra-tlcs900h#emulation</a></p>"},{"id":"e351cc52833ad807","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by tgv in \"Appeals Court Rules White House Overstepped First Amendment on Social Media\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:42:56 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:42:56 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1908,"y":440,"wires":[["cb046ba386db967e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444686\n<hr>\n<p>> how do we solve for the society-wide censorship problem<p>Or: how do we \"solve for\" the people-that-want-absolute-freedom-of-speech problem?

This applies regardless of what financial obligations they may have as a renter or homeowner and regardless of the situation of the rest of their family.<p>And if after their job ends they rush out of the country to meet the immigration deadline, any lingering ties to the US will make it harder for them to convince CBP to let them re-enter on visitor status, so the departure may in some circumstances be either temporarily or permanently one-way as well as rushed.<p>The severity of this disruption forces many H-1B workers to meekly put up with a lot more abuse and mistreatment at work than do US citizens, LPRs, and those lucky few categories of nonimmigrants whose work authorizations are not tied to their employment. Agreed, it’s not slavery, but it’s not full freedom either.<p>A more humane approach would be what Canada does: holders of Canadian employer-specific work permits who quit or lose their job are nevertheless legally allowed to remain in Canada until the date their current work permit expires. They can rely on that predictability when signing leases, planning their children’s education, and other matters. And it often gives them far more time than the tight US deadline to find a new employer to sponsor a subsequent work permit.</p>"},{"id":"d37025d6a4b3f435","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by bombcar in \"As wildfires burn across the world, what is the role of Australia's eucalyptus?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:42 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:42 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1120,"y":140,"wires":[["38d0207b7fa429ad"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444836\n<hr>\n<p>It was thought it might be - but it turned out not to work as such, too twisty.</p>"},{"id":"b2db6d744941a657","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by perihelions in \"Appeals Court Rules White House Overstepped First Amendment on Social Media\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:40 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:40 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1908,"y":640,"wires":[["cb046ba386db967e"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444835\n<hr>\n<p>pdf<p><a href=\"https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-30445-CV0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-30445-CV0.pd...</a></p>"},{"id":"47f4a12d9650a18c","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by zainhoda in \"Show HN: Vanna AI – Open-sourced text-to-SQL in Python\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:26 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 12:59:26 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":968,"y":1964,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37444833\n<hr>\n<p>It probably could but it would require adjusting the prompt.

I can't work out who did think this was a good idea.\"</i><p>Well, I'd very definitely agree with that comment. I have firsthand experience of eucalyptus trees and bushfires and I find it truly perplexing why people in other countries would want to put their lives and property at risk by planting this dangerous invasive species that often grows faster and more robustly there than it does in Australia.<p>I grew up in a very fire-prone part of Australia in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales west of Sydney and I've lived through some of the most devastating fires. At the end I've posted a link to a YouTube video of a fire I was caught up in as a kid. It was many decades ago but I still have vivid memories of the event. It's impossible to forget witnessing over a hundred homes and businesses burn down as the fire raged through the township.<p>Unless one's been caught up in a raging busfire it's almost impossible to visualize what it's really like, especially one involving eucalyptus trees, the roaring noise is almost deafening and suddenly trees just explode when the eucalypt oil ignites. It can be very frightening.<p>Luckily, my parents' home wasn't in the path of the fire it being several kilometers away but I saw the aftermath and I helped out with bringing bedding and provisions to the poor souls who'd lost their homes and possessions—list everything. It was a truly pitiful sight to see so many people crammed into the town hall floor space of the next town with hardly a footstep between them.<p>The video is quite long, about 30 min, and of course is a revisited historical video so the camera footage isn't a vivid as one expects nowadays. Nevertheless, it depicts the human loss very well indeed. When I first saw the video some years back I could feel myself reliving the event, it was quite uncanny. Incidentally, in the video one gets a quick glimpse of that town hall where the victims were temporarily rehoused.<p>From images of recent fires across the globe that have involved eucalyptus trees, it seems to me we ought to be severely limiting these foreign plantings. I recall years ago, when I first went to California and saw that the eucalyptus trees grew better there that in many parts of Australia I was horrified. From my experience it was clear to me what was going to happen there.<p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYOVnmkP0c\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYOVnmkP0c</a></p>"},{"id":"a164fba8a0ba4e87","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by fortran77 in \"U.S. Government Is Monitoring All Global Entry Members Daily\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 13:35:15 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 13:35:15 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":3275.5174951186264,"y":1449.2158751105262,"wires":[["9341078fdee276d9"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445232\n<hr>\n<p>Well, it's a little more than that.

The longer you stay and invest in your home and social life (which as a human you have to, otherwise you become a mindless drone), the more you are indentured to the system. Indenture is built into the visa contract – you cannot quit your current employer and stay unemployed even for a short period of time – even though you did contribute social security every single month, even though you paid all taxes every single month – you get no benefits.<p>So, you are in constant fear of losing your job and having to throw away your entire investment here. This means you will be pliable in many ways you would otherwise not be. You can be denied promotions, you can be given shitty/grunt work, you can be given borderline unethical work, you can be asked to fire other people in unsympathetic ways, you can be asked to work weekends and nights without any overtime pay, you can be asked to travel very long distances for work in economy class and so on and you shall not complain.<p>You can only suffer silently until you get another job.

Vaccines were first said to “prevent”[1], and then they moved the wording to being “less likely to spread”[2]. Social distancing only prolonged the pandemic and put more at risk, as the only way to reasonably mitigate a non-deadly and contagious disease for which we have no real vaccine against is to create herd immunity, just like we do with the flu every single year.

Globally, assuming an average of 100 hotels per city and 10,000 cities and 100 rooms per hotel. While any of those numbers could be argued to be off by an order of magnitude they aren't so far from the upper bound reality as a central booking platform. So you are only booking a maximum of 100M roomnights per day, or 4.1M roomnights per hour, or 70K roomnights per minute, or 1200 roomnights per second. The SQLite FAQ states that it can do 50,000 or more inserts per second on an average computer. <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q19</a> So there is no technical problem. Largely, namespacing guarantees uniqueness without the need for a shared ledger to facilitate greater parallelism.<p>Business-wise, if you are worried about contention, the locking is achieved within hotel reservation systems at two levels. One level is the channel, and another level is the hotel itself. The hotel itself holds the ultimate record of note with respect to forward room allocations, re-allocation powers, deferment and cancellation powers, etc. They are the arbiter of truth. However, because hassling staff or systems at the hotel are not always optimal distribution solutions, large channels such as major booking sites will often be hard or soft-allocated groups of rooms in bulk. They are then able to provide their own confident sub-assignment of these rooms before communicating the ultimate guest details to the hotel. Conceptually, this functions similarly to exchange-based trades in crypto, broker-based book allocations in the conventional financial services world, and so on.<p>The ultimate client-facing business process is generally handled with a soft booking at agreed rates, and then a hard confirmation of the receipt and agreement to booking by the hotel receiving the notification of such from the reservation channel. Different hotels offer different interfaces for this, but not so long ago a huge amount was still done by fax. It wouldn't surprise me if a great deal are still done manually by humans using email. Larger operations use APIs, but all fall back to each hotel's reservations department who have the power to issue contracts, change rates, and override agreements.<p>Source: Around 2007-2009 I developed from scratch a hotel reservation system operating in six human languages which grew to over 3,000 partner hotels. This is not so big these days but at the time was the same size as multiple NASDAQ listed operations.</p>"},{"id":"a5c1067a8b364b94","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by flangola7 in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:05:55 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:05:55 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-540,"y":-1620,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445596\n<hr>\n<p>Can it melt down into macrosize plastic?</p>"},{"id":"cfca5143245d4c73","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by arlort in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:05:50 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:05:50 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-760,"y":-1676,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445595\n<hr>\n<p>> Fresh of the boat immigrants are not entitled to welfare in Europe<p>If you mean healthcare then employed residents (what H1B is) are</p>"},{"id":"2a3b6b65d05931c9","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by ChemSpider in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:05:47 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:05:47 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-628,"y":-1564,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445594\n<hr>\n<p>Used with a proper (long) password, LP is safe.

Each hotel manages its own reservations. Booking.com probably plugs into the Central Reservation System for the hotel at some point along the chain whether it be at the chain level, the hotel level, or through something like the GDS (Global Distribution System). When booking.com starts a transaction it first asks for availability from the hotel, presents that availability to the user, then the user chooses if they want to accept any of the availability.<p>Once the user chooses the reservation it's blocked off directly in the Central Reservation System at the hotel so it can't be double booked.

My wireless keyboard runs on 2 standard batteries (AA or AAA, I can't remember which and am AFK). I must replace them about every year, it's a very short process, and I use rechargeables. I replaced my keyboard earlier this year due to water damage, so the batteries have outlasted the keyboard (which was about 7 years old). I admit, I don't use a mechanical keyboard (I use a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic) but is all of the above impossible in the mechanical space?<p>As for a negative that resonates, not fundamentally so: AFAIK, I cannot tinker with the firmware on my wireless keyboard. The real negative IMO, is that rarely, keys become unresponsive for 3 seconds (presumably due to wireless connectivity drop). It's annoying, but losing 3 seconds of work is manageable to say the least, and I don't use it for gaming.<p>On the whole, quite positive for wireless keyboards such as mine. A wireless mouse is a similar story.

Costs about $3.80 / gallon avg or roughly $1/L.<p>You can store it in a cool dry place inside a metal/plastic container for decades.<p>Cheap, light weight, space efficient, easy to transport and convert into mechanical/electrical/heat energy.<p>On the other hand, lithium ion battery has gravimetric density of 0.45MJ/kg - 0.7MJ/kg and volumetric density if 0.8MJ - 0.8 - 3.6 MJ/L.<p>So gasoline and its hydrocarbon cousins (kerosene, diesel, vegetable fat) are 50-100X gravimetric dense and 10-100X volumetric dense compared to Li-ion batteries.<p>This has huuuge implications on transport - especially air travel.<p>Now let’s look at solar. Sun gives us about 1350 watts/m2. With clouds and conversion losses solar panels capture about 300 watts/m2.<p>A standard US parking lot is 9ft by 18ft. That’s 15m2.<p>At 4.5 hours of sunlight on average summer day, if the parking lot was covered with solar panel, it would generate 4.5MW of energy.<p>Suppose hypothetically we could have an an artificial tree like technology that could convert solar to gasoline like hydrocarbon, like trees capture solar + CO2 + H20 into glucose + O2.<p>That artificial tree solar panel would generate equivalent of 20 gallons of gasoline per month.<p>Avg car consumes about 40 gallons a month. So 2 parking lots would generate enough energy for 1 car.<p>An area the size of New Zealand / Italy / UK (roughly 300km2) if covered with solar can meet energy needs of the entire planet.<p>IMO the holy grail of solar will be when we crack artificial tree like technology if we can crack solar -> dense hydrocarbon store and make it cheap.<p>Trees/plants are both materials and fuel. The best form of carbon capture I know of. Wood is one of the most renewable construction materials.<p>So if one could make an artificial tree that captured CO2 + solar and turned it into hydrocarbon fuel + high strength/light weight carbon-fibre-like wood, that would be the epic holy grail. Abundant high density green fuels + strong light weight building materials.<p>Fundamentally it is possible. I just don’t know how.<p>In the universe of all possible DNA, I think there exists a configuration of DNA that will yield a tree like that.<p>-<p>I may get downvoted for dreaming.

I briefly thought about it but discarded the option as I don't believe this would be really remunerative considering this is specific for the country I am living which is quite small (also it will be highly dependent of that specific web application and its API). \nStill, I believe it would be a nice thing to try to build a simple app (probably web rather than mobile) and share it with the local users. \nA dev would probably take a weekend to do the bulk of it, but I am not a dev :) and unfortunately family and work take enough time.<p>The way I see it would be something like:<p>- users will be able to simply register/login (or at least I need a way to map their choice to their notification \"address\" and avoid they spam others / allow them to modify/cancel a monitor - could be using some social login or magic links or classic user with mail.. )<p>- they will be able to select what they need to monitor (they type some word / site fetches options based on a list that is built by querying that remote site API and they select), specify few options (checkboxes or similar)<p>- a background process will run and check the availability based on the list of the users requests, see if anything has changed and notified the appropriate users when a slot is freed up (I used ntfy.sh for myself but it's probably not ideal for users to expect them to install the app so maybe I will have to use email or similar methods)<p>As Powershell is one of the thing that I know quite, I had thought about using Azure Functions (which I never used) as it can run Powershell, but I am open to other options as long as it doesn't mean becoming a full stack dev..<p>I am often lurking on HN and reading about automation tools, no code products, languages and such. \nMany nocode tools that I have seen discussed in HN are for internal apps/dashboards (budibase etc.) and bubble.io and similar might be expensive for running a free application (I would need to review what they offer and their tiers). Would products like n8n.io help or they would be useful only for the backend/integration part but not for building a user facing interface?\nWhat would you suggest to use to develop such app?<p>thanks</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445912\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445912</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"5ce7c91fd03ac50f","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Show HN: It's Like HN, but for Science","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:19 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:19 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-1412,"y":-1452,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://synthical.com/feed/simple\">https://synthical.com/feed/simple</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445905\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445905</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"ee301b8eb8df9161","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:12 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:12 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":-2364,"y":-388,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445903\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445903</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"385ea61e8529ae57","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Brainfuck Stark Tutorial","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:09 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:33:09 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1364,"y":-1732,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://neptune.cash/learn/brainfuck-tutorial/\">https://neptune.cash/learn/brainfuck-tutorial/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445900\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445900</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"d6bc245a97f01013","type":"subflow:a0c3c0a95c37a5ee","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"Marketing Bought an API","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:32:24 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:32:24 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":1612,"y":-1732,"wires":[[]],"info":"<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://bitdream.dev/posts/that-time-marketing-bought-an-api/\">https://bitdream.dev/posts/that-time-marketing-bought-an-api/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445894\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37445894</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>"},{"id":"24d391378caa4c2a","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by ttfkam in \"\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:49:46 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:49:46 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":36,"y":-1620,"wires":[[]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446057\n<hr>\n<p>Population density?

With performance, so much depends on your actual code and program-specific bottlenecks. The difference in runtime speed between JSC and V8 is minimal, so a lot of Bun optimization must be in the gaps between your code and the core JS engine or in startup time (e.g., running `bun install` or `bun test`).<p>In my benchmarks, our actual runtime performance of JS code is ~10-25% faster under Bun than under Node. However, sometimes Bun is 25-50% slower - notably with tasks that require binary processing (e.g, fflate, sharp) or encryption (e.g., jose). Considering we're committed to JS, we'll be constrained by its performance for a long time, so a \"free\" ~20% speed up at runtime is worth the effort, but it's not a 10x slam dunk like their numbers imply.</p>"},{"id":"5399e23c826f40a6","type":"subflow:0cbd7293686d6ad5","z":"431e7f996eed37ad","name":"New comment by guraf in \"Ask HN: Will Google delete inactive gmail accounts that forward email?\"","env":[{"name":"createdAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:55:13 +0000","type":"str"},{"name":"updatedAt","value":"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 14:55:13 +0000","type":"str"}],"x":24,"y":628,"wires":[["d2fa8aa457880202"]],"info":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37446121\n<hr>\n<p>> That's what email forwarding is, i.e. using IMAP or POP.<p>No, mail forwarding is SMTP and requires no access to pop/imap.
